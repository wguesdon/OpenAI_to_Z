Summary
Background

Archaeological evidence of low-density urbanism has been found in Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, and Central America, but was previously unknown in pre-Hispanic Amazonia beyond some interconnected settlements in the southern region
The Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia represents one of the most extensive seasonally flooded Amazonian savannahs (120,000 km²)

Study Area and Methods

Culture: Casarabe culture (AD 500-1400)
Location: Llanos de Mojos savannah-forest mosaic, southwest Amazonia
Coverage: 4,500 km² total culture area; 204 km² mapped with lidar across 6 areas
Technology: Airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) mapping

Key Findings
Settlement Hierarchy
The study identified a four-tiered settlement system:

Large settlement sites (>100 ha): Cotoca (147 ha) and Landívar (315 ha)
Secondary centers: 21-41 ha with base platforms of 2-6 ha
Tertiary centers: ~0.5 ha base platforms with single structures
Small elevated sites: Average 0.34 ha "forest islands"

Architectural Features

Monumental structures:

Stepped platforms with U-shaped structures
Rectangular platform mounds
Conical pyramids up to 22 meters tall
Concentric polygonal defensive banks and moats


Infrastructure:

Straight raised causeways connecting settlements over several kilometers
Massive water management systems with canals and reservoirs
7-km canal bringing water from Laguna San José to Cotoca



Settlement Pattern

Dense, integrated settlement system with an average of 10 sites within a 10-km radius
Higher density in eastern sector (1,800-3,970 m between settlements)
Sites clustered and interconnected, forming areas of 100-500 km²
Cotoca controlled approximately 500 km² including 18 other monumental sites

Significance

First evidence of low-density urbanism in the tropical lowlands of South America
Challenges previous assumptions that western Amazonia was sparsely populated in pre-Hispanic times
Scale comparable to Andean cultures: Labor investment at Cotoca (570,690 m³) was 10 times greater than Tiwanaku's largest structure
Demonstrates sophisticated society with:

Complex civic-ceremonial architecture
Advanced water management
Regional settlement networks
Agricultural base (primarily maize cultivation)



Archaeological Context

189 large monumental sites documented
273 smaller sites identified
957 km of canals and causeways mapped
Population practiced year-round agriculture, hunting, and fishing

Implications
This discovery contributes to understanding global urban diversity and redefines categories for past and present Amazonian societies, demonstrating that the Amazon supported complex, low-density urban civilizations comparable to those found in other tropical regions worldwide.
