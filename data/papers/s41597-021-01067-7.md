Summary
Background

Published maps show very few archaeological sites in western Amazonia compared to the Brazilian Amazon
Previous basin-wide maps identified fewer than two dozen sites in the Peruvian Amazon
This apparent paucity has led some scientists to suggest limited Pre-Columbian human occupation in western Amazonia

Key Findings

415 archaeological sites documented in the Department of Loreto, Peru
This challenges the notion of sparse human occupation in prehistory
Sites were compiled from unpublished archival materials held by Peru's Ministry of Culture and other sources

Data Description
The database includes for each site:

Geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude)
Site name and code
Administrative location (department, province, district)
Elevation data
References to corresponding documentation

Distribution of Sites

33% in Loreto province (134 sites)
28% in Datem del Marañón (115 sites)
15% in Alto Amazonas (62 sites)
14% in Maynas (59 sites)
6% in Ucayali (23 sites)
Remaining 4% distributed among other provinces

Significance

Archaeological Research: Provides foundation for understanding Pre-Columbian occupation, settlement patterns, and cultural change
Conservation & Development: Informs land use planning and site preservation efforts
Indigenous Rights: Supports indigenous land claims and cultural heritage protection

Limitations

Some sites may have been destroyed by river dynamics (5% now in active river channels)
Additional undocumented sites likely exist
Limited descriptive information about site characteristics

Technical Details

36% of sites are registered with the Ministry of Culture
13% have formal site codes
Data compiled over 20 years by archaeologist Santiago Rivas Panduro
Locations verified using Google Earth imagery in 2020

This database represents the most comprehensive compilation of archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon to date, fundamentally challenging assumptions about the extent of Pre-Columbian human presence in western Amazonia.
