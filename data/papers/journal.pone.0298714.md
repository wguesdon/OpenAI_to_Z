Summary
Background
This study examines the extent and spatial patterns of pre-Columbian human impacts at three ring ditch sites in French Guiana's hinterland. Ring ditches (locally called "Montagne Couronnées") are geometric earthworks that provide evidence of pre-Columbian territorial occupation in Amazonia. While over 50 such sites have been identified in French Guiana, their impact on surrounding landscapes remains poorly understood.
Study Sites

MC87: Located in the Kourouaï River watershed (85m elevation, ~3800mm annual rainfall)
NOUR (Nouragues): Located on a granite plateau in the Arataï River watershed (~3200-3400mm rainfall)
GALB (Mont Galbao): Located in the Inipi-Camopi metamorphic chain (lowest rainfall of the three sites)

Methods
The researchers conducted extensive soil surveys along approximately 1km-long transects extending from ring ditch enclosures through surrounding forest landscapes. They analyzed multiple indicators:

Archaeological artifacts (ceramic shards, macrocharcoals, soots)
Soil colorimetry using Munsell color charts
Physicochemical properties (granulometry, pH, nutrients)
Microcharcoal abundance (160μm-2mm particles)
Radiocarbon dating of macrocharcoals

Key Findings
Occupation Periods

Two main occupation periods identified across all sites:

Early period: 5th-10th century CE (430-976 CE)
Late period: 13th-15th century CE (1214-1490 CE)


Evidence of discontinuous occupation with periods of abandonment and reoccupation

Spatial Distribution of Disturbances

Anthropogenic disturbances decreased from ring ditch enclosures to surrounding areas
Within enclosures: Highest concentrations of artifacts, darker soils, chemical enrichments
Ring ditch slopes: Intermediate levels of disturbance
Adjacent hills: Lower but still detectable anthropogenic signatures
Bottomlands: Little to no archaeological evidence

Soil Characteristics

Chemical enrichments detected: organic carbon (Corg), nitrogen (N), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca)
Darker soil colors within ring ditch enclosures, particularly in terra-firme areas
Soils did not meet full criteria for Amazonian Dark Earths (terra preta)
Instead classified as Amazonian Brown Earths - a less intensively modified anthrosol

Fire Management Evidence

Abundant macro- and microcharcoals throughout sites
Localized enrichments suggest in-situ fire management
Likely used for forest clearance and/or slash-and-burn cultivation
Fire use was patchy rather than extensive landscape burning

Implications
The study demonstrates that pre-Columbian societies made extensive use of landscapes beyond just ring ditch enclosures. The evidence supports a model of "domestic landscapes" with extended, long-term human impacts on forest areas. The identification of Amazonian Brown Earths rather than Dark Earths suggests a need to broaden the definition of anthropogenic soils in Amazonia to include less intensively modified soils.
Significance
This research provides one of the first landscape-scale assessments of pre-Columbian disturbances in French Guiana, contributing to our understanding of ancient human-environment interactions in the Guiana Shield region of Amazonia. The continuous sampling approach and multi-proxy analysis offer a comprehensive view of how pre-Columbian societies shaped their landscapes over centuries of occupation.
