Summary: Predicting Ancient Amazonian Archaeological Sites with Machine Learning
Overview
This study develops a machine learning model to predict the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites, addressing questions about the extent of pre-Columbian human landscape modifications across Amazonia.
Key Methods

Algorithm: Random forest classifier (multi-class classification)
Data: 2,032 known archaeological sites:

510 Amazonian Dark Earth sites (ADEs)
1,100 earthworks (mostly geoglyphs)
422 other archaeological sites


Predictors: 65 geospatial variables including:

Soil characteristics (phosphorus levels, etc.)
Climate data (temperature, precipitation)
Distances to rivers, lakes, and coasts


Validation: Spatial cross-validation with 5 folds (500 km blocks)
Resolution: 30 arc-second (~1 km) spatial scale

Main Findings
Model Performance

Achieved Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91
Accuracy: 88%
Mean sensitivity: 83%
Mean specificity: 90%

Geographic Patterns

Earthworks: Concentrated across the southern rim of Amazonia, particularly in areas with:

Higher temperature seasonality
Better soil phosphorus levels
Proximity to black and clear rivers


ADEs: Densely distributed along:

Lower stretches of major rivers (especially the Amazon)
Eastern seaboard/Atlantic coast
Areas with intermediate phosphorus levels


Other sites: Predicted to dominate most of western and northern Amazonia (>2/3 of total area)

Practical Applications

The model successfully led to the discovery of 13 new geoglyphs
Identified specific forested areas with high probability (>0.8) of containing undiscovered sites
Eight protected areas identified as hotspots for future archaeological investigations

Key Implications

Ancient Amazonian social complexity, while impressive, appears geographically limited to less than one-third of Amazonia
The distinct geographic distributions of earthworks vs. ADEs suggest different cultural adaptations and land use strategies
Urgency for preservation as many sites are being degraded by deforestation and development

Future Directions

Integration with LiDAR technology for discovering sites under forest canopy
Ground-truthing of high-probability areas identified by the model
Iterative improvement: new discoveries can enhance model training data

Significance
This research provides a powerful predictive tool for archaeological discovery and preservation in Amazonia, demonstrating that machine learning can effectively guide field research and conservation efforts in one of the world's most important archaeological regions.
