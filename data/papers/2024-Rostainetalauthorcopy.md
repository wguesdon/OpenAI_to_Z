Summary
Overview
This groundbreaking study reveals an extensive pre-Hispanic urban system in the Upano Valley of Amazonian Ecuador, representing the earliest and largest example of low-density agrarian urbanism documented in the Amazon basin to date.
Key Findings
Settlement System

Dense urban network discovered in the eastern foothills of the Andes using fieldwork and LiDAR analysis
Over 6,000 earthen platforms identified within a 300 km² area
15 settlements classified into two categories:

5 major sites (large/dense centers)
10 secondary sites


Platform density averages 16.6 platforms/km², with some areas exceeding 100 features/km²

Chronology

Occupation period: ~500 BCE to 300/600 CE
Cultural sequence:

Sangay culture (700-500 BCE)
Kilamope culture (500 BCE onwards) - first mound builders
Upano culture (500 BCE-300/600 CE) - main builders
Huapula culture (800-1200 CE) - reoccupied abandoned mounds
Shuar culture (descendants of Huapula)



Infrastructure
Roads and Pathways

Complex road system extending over tens of kilometers
Four types of roads identified:

Straight dug footpaths and roads (2-3m deep, 4-15m wide)
Roads following topographic relief
Elevated causeways with parallel ditches
Paths utilizing natural gullies


Longest roads exceed 14-25 km in length

Agricultural Features

Drained fields: Orthogonal plot systems covering hundreds of hectares

Rectangular fields 10-40m wide
Ditches 4m wide, 40cm deep for drainage


Terraces: Along quebrada edges and slopes
Agricultural areas filled "gaps" between residential complexes

Architecture

Standard platform shape: Rectangular (few circular), ~20×10m, 2-3m high
Platform complexes: Groups of 3-6 units around plazas
Monumental complexes: Much larger platforms (e.g., Kilamope's 140×40m platform)
Defensive features: Peripheral ditches and obstructed roads at some sites

Methods

20+ years of interdisciplinary fieldwork
LiDAR survey (2015): 600 km² area with 1m resolution DEM
Archaeological excavations at Sangay and Kilamope sites
Archaeobotanical analysis revealing crops: maize, beans, manioc, sweet potato

Significance

Earliest example of extensive urbanism in Amazonia (2,500 years ago)
"Garden urbanism" model: Integration of residential, ceremonial, and agricultural spaces
Comparable scale to Maya urban systems and other ancient civilizations
Challenges assumptions about Amazonia as pristine forest
Evidence of complex society with advanced engineering and planning capabilities

Unique Features

Geometric road network cutting across topography (possible cosmological significance)
Hierarchical settlement pattern with major centers and satellites
Intensive landscape modification including platforms, roads, and agricultural systems
Long-distance connections via road network creating regional integration

Comparisons
The study compares Upano settlements to:

Maya lowland cities (similar scale and complexity)
Egyptian Giza Plateau and Teotihuacan (ceremonial core sizes)
Other Amazonian sites (Llanos de Mojos, Upper Xingu, etc.)

Conclusions
This discovery fundamentally revises understanding of pre-Columbian Amazonia, demonstrating that complex urban societies with sophisticated infrastructure existed in the "pristine" rainforest 2,500 years ago. The Upano Valley represents an indigenous development of low-density agrarian urbanism that integrated monumental architecture, extensive road networks, and intensive agriculture into a coherent cultural landscape.
