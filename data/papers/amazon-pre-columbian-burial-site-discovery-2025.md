## Summary

### Discovery
In October 2024, fishermen from the Arumanduba community in Brazil's Amazonas state discovered ancient funerary urns beneath a fallen tree in the Amazon rainforest. The discovery site is located in the Médio Solimões region, municipality of Fonte Boa, and was reported to local authorities who contacted the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development.

### Archaeological Excavation
A team of archaeologists from the Mamirauá Institute, led by Márcio Amaral and Geórgea Layla Holanda, conducted excavation work in January 2025. The journey to the remote site required 24 hours by boat along the Amazon River. The archaeological materials were found beneath 40 centimeters of earth where the tree had fallen.

### Key Findings

#### Funerary Urns
- **Quantity**: 7 ceramic funerary urns discovered
- **Size**: Largest urn measures 90cm opening diameter and 55cm height (approximately 770 pounds with sediment)
- **Materials**: Made from clay mixed with cauxi (freshwater sponge) and caraipé (tree bark ash) for enhanced durability
- **Contents**: Human bones found inside the urns
- **Style**: Belongs to the Amazonian polychrome tradition with red and white coloring over white background

#### Site Characteristics
- Part of a system of 70 artificial islands called "Aterrados e Cavadas" (landfills and excavations)
- Evidence of advanced pre-Columbian engineering and construction capabilities
- Demonstrates sophisticated landscape modification for permanent floodplain habitation

### Cultural Significance

#### Burial Practices
The researchers identified evidence of complex funerary rituals involving:
1. Primary burial (ground burial or river placement for soft tissue removal)
2. Bone disarticulation and cremation
3. Secondary burial in ceramic urns
4. Sealing and final burial of the urns

#### Indigenous Engineering
The artificial island system represents sophisticated environmental adaptation, including:
- Permanent settlement construction in challenging floodplain environments
- Advanced agroforestry management techniques
- Landscape modification for plant cultivation

### Current Challenges and Future Research

#### Dating
- Current age estimate: 200 to 3,000 years old
- Precise dating pending due to funding constraints

#### Research Limitations
- Lack of funding for laboratory tests
- Difficulty correlating findings with present-day Indigenous groups
- Need for extensive analysis to establish cultural connections

#### Importance
According to archaeologist Geórgea Holanda, this archaeological work helps tell "silenced stories" and gives Indigenous peoples "the protagonism they deserve – those who truly built the Amazon and who were already here in Brazil long before the invasion."

### Institution
The Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development, financed by Brazil's Ministry of Science, accepts donations to support ongoing research and preservation of these important archaeological discoveries.
