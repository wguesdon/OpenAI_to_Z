# Optimal OCR Workflows for 16th–19th-Century Portuguese and Spanish Expedition Journals
====================================================================

## Introduction

The accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) workflows for 16th–19th-century Portuguese and Spanish expedition journals is crucial for researchers and historians. This report aims to identify the most effective OCR workflows for these historical documents.

## Restatement of the Question

Which OCR workflows give the best accuracy on 16th–19th-century Portuguese and Spanish expedition journals?

## Overview of OCR Workflows

Several OCR workflows have been proposed for historical documents, including:

### 1. Deep Learning-based Approaches

* **Character Recognition of Seventeenth-Century Spanish American Notary Records Using Deep Learning** [digitalhumanities.org](https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000581/000581.html): This approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize characters in historical documents. The authors achieved high accuracy by verifying the generated dataset with professional historians.
* **Transcription of Spanish Historical Handwritten Documents with Deep Neural Networks** [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/4/1/15): This work proposes a solution that combines a powerful optical recognition system with a language model based on sub-lexical units. The authors achieved promising results on the Rodrigo dataset.

### 2. Freely Available Models and Tools

* **Portuguese Handwriting 16th-19th century** [readcoop.eu](https://readcoop.eu/model/portuguese-handwriting-16th-19th-century/): This model is freely available for use with Transkribus and can be used for automatic transcription of handwritten documents.
* **Reading in the mist: high-quality optical character recognition based on freely available early modern digitized books** [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/37/4/1197/6564120): This paper illustrates how to achieve high-quality OCR using freely available early modern digitized books.

### 3. Large Language Model-based Approaches

* **Historical Ink: 19th Century Latin American Spanish Newspaper Corpus with LLM OCR Correction** [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12838): This paper presents a framework for OCR error correction and linguistic surface form detection using a Large Language Model.

## Comparison of OCR Workflows

| Workflow | Accuracy | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Learning-based Approaches | High | Uses CNNs and language models to recognize characters |
| Freely Available Models and Tools | Medium-High | Uses pre-trained models and tools for transcription |
| Large Language Model-based Approaches | High | Uses Large Language Models for OCR error correction |

## Conclusion

The best OCR workflows for 16th–19th-century Portuguese and Spanish expedition journals are:

1. Deep Learning-based Approaches, such as those using CNNs and language models.
2. Large Language Model-based Approaches, such as those using LLM OCR correction.

These workflows have shown high accuracy in recognizing characters and transcribing historical documents.
