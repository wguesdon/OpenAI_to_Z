# Open Archaeological Databases Containing Verified Site Locations in the Amazon

**Question:**  
Are there any open archaeological databases containing verified site locations in the Amazon?

---

## Introduction

The Amazon rainforest, spanning several South American countries, is a region rich in archaeological heritage. It contains numerous ancient human settlements and cultural sites that are of high interest for researchers. For archaeological research and heritage preservation, having access to databases that contain verified locations of these sites is crucial.

## Existing Databases and Resources

### Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA)

- The **Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA)** is a comprehensive open-access project that catalogs Paleoindian projectile points and other artifacts primarily across North America but has expanded to include data from Canada, Mexico, and all of the Americas.
- While its primary focus is North America, the database includes verified site locations and data that extend into parts of South America, potentially encompassing areas related to the Amazon region.
- The database aims to expand continuously as more contributors update and add verified data.
- Access it here: [opencontext.org](https://opencontext.org/projects/d75ef68a-0e23-458c-976d-286d83c13013)

### Geo-Referenced Database of Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Sites in Brazil

- There is a GIS-based geo-referenced database constructed to document Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene archaeological records in Brazil.
- Given that the Brazilian Amazon is part of Brazil's vast geography, this database may include verified early archaeological site locations within the Amazon basin or its bordering areas.
- This dataset incorporates stratigraphic information and radiocarbon dates for verified site locations, enhancing its credibility and usefulness to researchers.
- The database details and research are available in academic repositories: [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/11548691/The_Late_Pleistocene_Early_Holocene_archaeological_record_in_Brazil_A_geo_referenced_database), [semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Late-Pleistocene%2FEarly-Holocene-archaeological-Bueno-Dias/64bf3cd2268d3d37a7d01c6f3a5ad075501a2150)

### National Archaeological Site Inventories in Peru

- Peru, part of the western Amazon region, has national platforms documenting archaeological sites.
- The **SIGDA (Sistema de Información Geográfica para la Gestión del Patrimonio Arqueológico)** platform in Peru archives verified archaeological sites with geospatial data.
- Although SIGDA itself is primarily for Peruvian sites and may extend partially into Amazonian zones, it serves as a regional model for verified open archaeological data.
- Access it here: [sigda.cultura.gob.pe](https://sigda.cultura.gob.pe/)

## Summary

Currently, while there is no single unified global open database exclusively dedicated to archaeological sites solely in the Amazon basin, researchers do have access to:

- **The Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA)** with some coverage in South America.
- **Brazil-focused geo-referenced databases** covering ancient site locations including Amazonian areas.
- **National platforms like Peru's SIGDA**, covering parts of the western Amazon.

These databases include verified archaeological site locations relevant to the Amazon and are open or publicly accessible through academic or governmental sites.

Researchers often integrate data from these sources coupled with GIS tools to obtain comprehensive spatial understanding of Amazon archaeological sites.
