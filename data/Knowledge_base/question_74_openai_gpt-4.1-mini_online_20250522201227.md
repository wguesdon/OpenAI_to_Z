# Correspondence Between Modern Indigenous Reserve Boundaries and Historical Occupation Cores Inferred from Ceramic-Style Catchments

**Question:**  
*How do modern Indigenous reserve boundaries correspond to historical occupation cores inferred from ceramic-style catchments?*

---

## Introduction

Understanding how contemporary Indigenous reserve boundaries align with historical patterns of occupation is important for both archaeological interpretation and Indigenous heritage rights. One method used to infer historical occupation areas is through analyzing ceramic-style catchments—geographic areas defined by the sourcing and distribution of pottery styles and materials, often linked to distinct cultural groups and resource areas utilized by Indigenous peoples.

This report explores the relationship between modern Indigenous reserve boundaries and prehistoric occupation cores as inferred from ceramic-style catchments, drawing on recent archaeological and ethnohistoric research.

## Ceramic-Style Catchments and Historical Occupation Cores

Ceramic-style catchments are areas where pottery of specific mineral and chemical composition have been found and are assumed to correspond with past manufacture and use of pottery by specific cultural groups. These catchments are defined by linking compositional analysis of ceramics with geological resources such as clay deposits and temper materials.

- The **Ceramic Resource Area Model (CRAM)** has been used to link resource areas to pottery production and mobility patterns. It emphasizes a dynamic understanding of pottery use and manufacture, moving beyond static models of past Indigenous behaviors.  
- CRAM-based research indicates that these catchments correlate to clusters or cores of occupation, where communities produced and used pottery reflective of their cultural and resource environments.  
- However, CRAM assumptions often rely on ethnographic analogies of foot-based resource transport, which may not fully account for technologies such as canoe travel or modern transportation, complicating direct linking of ceramic catchments to spatial occupation areas [sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0197693118825401).

## Modern Indigenous Reserve Boundaries

Modern reserves were often established through colonial and governmental processes that did not always align with traditional lands or resource use patterns. Consequently:

- Reserve boundaries may not precisely overlap with the ancestral occupation cores inferred archaeologically.  
- They are frequently smaller in size or fragmented, influenced by colonial negotiations, treaties, or policy decisions rather than by traditional spatial organization or resource catchments.  
- Despite this, many reserves are situated within broader ancestral territories, indicating some level of spatial correspondence.

## Comparative Studies and Case Examples

Several studies have examined the relationship between Indigenous territories, archaeological sites, and reservation boundaries in regions such as British Columbia and Manitoba:

- In northern Manitoba, resource areas used for pottery manufacture identified through ceramic composition studies do indicate core zones of occupation and interaction, linked to mobility and resource accessibility. These zones may partially intersect with modern reserve lands but are often broader and more permeable than current administrative boundaries [sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0197693118825401).
  
- In southwest British Columbia, radiocarbon dating and spatial modeling in traditional Tsleil-Waututh-Coast Salish territory suggest long-term continuity of occupation at multiple spatial scales. Modern reserve lands correspond broadly to these territories, although detailed archaeological occupation cores may extend beyond current reserve limits, reflecting larger traditional territories [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416517302258).

- Archaeological sites on British Columbia's Central Coast, such as on Triquet Island, demonstrate persistent occupation over millennia, with multiple small sites reflecting complex use of coastal resources. Some Indigenous land claims and reserve areas overlap these sites, but archaeological evidence shows use of larger landscapes than those defined by reserve boundaries [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X23000597).

## Summary

- Modern Indigenous reserve boundaries **partly correspond** to the historical occupation cores that ceramic-style catchments infer, but do not fully encompass them. This is due to the broader and more dynamic nature of past Indigenous land use, the limitations of ceramic catchment models, and the often arbitrary or politically driven delineation of reserve lands.
- Archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence supports a view of Indigenous territories as fluid and extending beyond modern reserves, with occupation cores identifiable in ceramic patterns generally larger or differently configured than reserve lands.
- Understanding these differences emphasizes the importance of taking long-term spatial and cultural continuity into account when discussing Indigenous land rights and heritage management.
