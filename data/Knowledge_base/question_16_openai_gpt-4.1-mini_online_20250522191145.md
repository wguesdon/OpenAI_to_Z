# Locations of Known Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Rainforest

**Question:**  
*What are the locations of known archaeological sites in the Amazon Rainforest (give coordinates so I can locate them on a map)*

---

## Introduction

The Amazon Rainforest, spanning multiple countries in South America, is home to numerous archaeological sites, some recently uncovered through advanced surveying technologies like LiDAR. These sites include earthworks, mounded villages, and other cultural remains from pre-Columbian times.

This report provides specific geographic coordinates for some known archaeological sites in the Amazon Rainforest based on recent studies and reliable data sources, allowing precise location on maps.

## Known Archaeological Sites and Their Coordinates

### 1. Paratoari (Pyramids of Paratoari), Peru
- Known as natural pyramid-shaped formations that have attracted archaeological interest.
- **Coordinates:**  
  - Latitude:  -12° 40' 14.02" S (Decimal: -12.6706)  
  - Longitude: -71° 27' 24.19" W (Decimal: -71.4567)  
- Located in the Manu area of the southeastern Peruvian Amazon rainforest.

### 2. Fonte Boa Site, Brazil (Illustrative)
- A site with a mounded ring village and geometric enclosures typical of earthwork cultures.
- Reference coordinates are approximate from the study area in the Brazilian Amazon near Acre.
- [Image and detailed study are available](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7)

### 3. Various Geoglyph Sites, Southwest Amazon Basin
- Thousands of earthworks have been detected primarily in the southwest Amazon basin.
- Concentrated near the borders of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru.
- No unified list with exact coordinates in this report, but models predict widespread distributions, and LiDAR mapping continues to reveal new sites.

## Additional Information on Archaeological Site Coordinates and Records

- Archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon are often coded by location, e.g., LOR (Loreto department), COR (Corrientes River), with unique site numbers assigned by the Ministerio de Cultura or archaeologists.  
- Many sites remain unpublished or unregistered but have been documented in scientific data with name and coordinates.

## Summary Table of Coordinates for Key Sites

| Site Name          | Country | Latitude    | Longitude    | Comments                                |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Paratoari          | Peru    | -12.6706    | -71.4567     | Pyramid-like natural formations        |
| Fonte Boa (approx.)| Brazil  | ~ -7.1      | ~ -66.88     | Mounded ring village and earthworks    |

*Note:* These coordinates can be entered into any standard mapping software or geographic information system (GIS) to locate the sites precisely.

## Conclusion

The Amazon hosts numerous archaeological sites featuring ancient earthworks and settlements, many concentrated in the southwest and southern rim of the basin. Paratoari in Peru is one of the more famous coordinate-marked sites accessible for mapping. Ongoing studies and technologies like laser mapping suggest thousands of additional sites remain to be fully documented and geolocated.
