# Locations of Suspected Archaeological Sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest
## Introduction

The Brazilian Amazon Rainforest is a vast and largely unexplored region, with a rich cultural heritage that dates back thousands of years. Despite its importance, much of the region's archaeological record remains uncharted. Recent studies have employed machine learning techniques and LiDAR data to predict the locations of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites.

## Restating the Question

What are the locations of suspected archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest from the literature that have not yet been confirmed?

## Suspected Archaeological Sites

Several studies have identified potential archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. For example, [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/) used machine learning models to predict the distribution of earthworks, ADEs, and other non-earthwork/non-ADE sites in the region. Their results suggest that the geographic distributions of these site types are mostly distinct.

*   A study published in [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1417198) used LiDAR data to identify potential archaeological sites in the Santarém region, Lower Amazon. The authors found a pattern of non-randomly distributed depressions that extended far into the densely forested Tapajós National Forest.
*   [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29588444/) reported the discovery of Pre-Columbian ditched enclosures in the Tapajós headwaters, which suggests that an 1800 km stretch of southern Amazonia was occupied by earth-building cultures living in fortified villages around 1250-1500 AD.
*   [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7.pdf) documented hundreds of archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon, which challenges the notion of sparse early human occupation in the outer Amazon basin.

## Predicted Locations

While the exact locations of suspected archaeological sites are not publicly available, the studies mentioned above provide some insights into the regions that are likely to contain such sites. These regions include:

*   The Belterra Plateau, south of the present-day city of Santarém
*   The Tapajós National Forest
*   The Tapajós headwaters
*   The Lower Ucayali River
*   The interfluves and minor tributaries of southern Amazonia

## Conclusion

The locations of suspected archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest are largely predicted based on machine learning models and LiDAR data. While the exact locations are not publicly available, the studies mentioned above provide insights into the regions that are likely to contain such sites. Further research and exploration are needed to confirm the presence of these sites and to uncover the secrets of the region's rich cultural heritage.
