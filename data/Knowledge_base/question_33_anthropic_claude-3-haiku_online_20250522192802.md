# Comparing Accounts of Early European Explorers

## Question

How do accounts from different European explorers contradict or corroborate each other?

## Introduction

The early exploration of the world by European powers in the 15th and 16th centuries generated a wealth of travel narratives and first-hand accounts. These accounts provide valuable insights into the experiences and perspectives of the explorers, as well as the cultures and environments they encountered. However, as these accounts were often written by different individuals with varying backgrounds and agendas, they may sometimes contradict or corroborate one another.

## Contradictions and Corroborations in Explorers' Accounts

[Pigafetta's Account of Magellan's Voyage](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_First_Voyage_Round_the_World/Pigafetta%27s_Account_of_Magellan%27s_Voyage) provides a detailed narrative of Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe in the early 16th century. Pigafetta, who was a crew member on the voyage, offers a firsthand perspective on the expedition's challenges and discoveries.

Similarly, [Magellan's Voyage Around the World](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008001532;seq=144) by Charles E. Nowell compiles and analyzes various contemporary accounts of Magellan's voyage, including those by Pigafetta, Maximilian of Transylvania, and Gaspar Corrêa. By comparing these multiple perspectives, Nowell is able to identify areas of both contradiction and corroboration.

For example, the accounts may differ in their details of specific events or their assessments of the actions and decisions of the expedition's leadership. However, they generally align on the overall trajectory of the voyage and the major milestones achieved.

[The First Voyage Around the World, 1519-1522](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/50/monograph/book/104240) by Antonio Pigafetta, edited by Theodore J. Cachey Jr., further highlights the value of Pigafetta's account as a comprehensive and remarkably accurate ethnographic and geographical record of the circumnavigation.

Additionally, [The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/47927/47927-h/47927-h.htm) presents a collection of documents and narratives related to the early European exploration and colonization of the Philippines, which can be used to corroborate or contradict other accounts.

## Conclusion

The accounts of early European explorers, while often containing contradictions in their details, can also be used to corroborate and validate one another's findings. By carefully analyzing and comparing these diverse perspectives, researchers and historians can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the experiences and accomplishments of these pioneering voyages of discovery.
