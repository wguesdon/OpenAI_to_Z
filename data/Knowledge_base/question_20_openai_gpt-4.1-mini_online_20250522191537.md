# Size of the Largest Confirmed Pre-Columbian Settlements in the Amazon

**Restated Question:**  
*How large were the largest confirmed pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon?*

## Introduction

The pre-Columbian Amazon has long been debated regarding the size and permanence of its ancient settlements. Recent archaeological, lidar, and satellite research has considerably shifted understanding, revealing large, complex, and often permanent settlements that challenge past assumptions about population density and societal organization in this region.

## Largest Known Pre-Columbian Settlement Sizes

### 1. Large Permanent Settlements Along the Lower Negro and Upper Xingu Rivers

- Archaeological studies in Brazil's Amazon, particularly along the lower Negro and upper Xingu Rivers, have identified large, permanent Amerindian settlements.
- These sites are approximately **30 to 50 hectares** in size.
- Research indicates these sites supported relatively dense regional populations, suggesting fully sedentary lifestyles were possible throughout various Amazonian ecological zones, not confined to areas with fertile soils alone.

### 2. Casarabe Culture Settlements in Bolivian Amazon

- Lidar investigations uncovered large settlement sites from the Casarabe culture covering about **500 square kilometers**.
- The sites were complex, including platform mounds, conical pyramids up to 22 meters tall, polygonal earthworks, and extensive water management systems.
- These were central nodes connected by causeways several kilometers long, showing a type of "low-density urbanism."
- This discovery represents some of the largest and most architecturally sophisticated pre-Hispanic settlements in the Amazon.

### 3. Geoglyph Culture in Upper Purús (Western Amazonia)

- Satellite and cleared land surveys revealed a society that built **geometric earthworks** interconnected by straight orthogonal roads.
- The "geoglyph culture" covers a region more than **250 kilometers across**.
- This extensive area involved earthworks spanning floodplains and uplands, suggesting not just large settlements but a wide spatial distribution of complex societies.

### 4. Southern Rim of the Amazon Earthworks

- Evidence suggests earthworks and settlements were distributed continuously along an east-west belt of approximately **1,800 kilometers** along the southern periphery of the Amazon.
- This distribution points to large-scale, connected populations practicing settled village life over a very large area.
- These settlements were linked by ranked social organizations and inter-community exchange, indicating a significant human footprint.

## Summary and Insights

- The largest confirmed settlements themselves range from **30–50 hectares** in certain riverine areas.
- However, some individual cultural centers, like those of the Casarabe culture, controlled **territories of approximately 500 km²**.
- Geoglyph-building societies occupied areas extending over hundreds of kilometers, and networks of earthworks span nearly 2,000 kilometers.
- These findings collectively redefine the Amazon prehistory, showing that **pre-Columbian Amazonian populations built large, sedentary, and complex communities**, sometimes resembling low-density urbanism.
