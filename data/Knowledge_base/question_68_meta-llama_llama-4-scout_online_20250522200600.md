# Least-Cost Path Analysis and Regional Road Networks
## Introduction

Least-cost path analysis is a method used in archaeology and geography to model the most efficient routes between two points on a landscape, taking into account factors such as terrain, slope, and distance. This technique has been applied to various studies to understand ancient road networks, trade routes, and communication systems.

## What is Least-Cost Path Analysis?

Least-cost path analysis is a technique used to determine the most efficient or cost-effective path between two points on a landscape. It takes into account various factors such as terrain, slope, distance, and energy expenditure to model the optimal route.

## Applications in Archaeology

The application of least-cost path analysis in archaeology has provided valuable insights into the organization and structure of ancient societies. For instance, [Newhard et al. (2013)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anatolian-studies/article/abs/leastcost-pathway-analysis-and-interregional-interaction-in-the-goksu-valley-turkey/2D42161830CA9C91A6D9E4A7A84AF938) used this method to test whether the Göksu valley in Turkey could serve as a communication route based on geographical constraints.

## Case Studies

### Chaco Regional Road System

A study on the Chaco regional road system [Newhard et al., 2019](https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.36) used least-cost path analysis to model timber importation routes. The results revealed a strong correlation between actual road locations and modeled pathways, suggesting that certain Chaco roads may have been specifically designed to facilitate the importation of timbers.

### Olmec Trade Routes

Least-cost path analysis was also used to explore travel routes between the Gulf Coast and Soconusco regions of Mexico [Rosenswig et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320300686). The study compared the Tobler Hiking Function and the Anaya Hernandez method to determine the LCP routes for each period and calculated changes required to make the voyage as one Gulf Coast center eclipsed the other.

### Roman Roads in NW Iberian Peninsula

Another study applied least-cost path analysis to identify the main locations taken into account when defining routes, rather than predicting or reconstructing them [Güimil-Fariña & Parcero-Oubiña, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440314004439). The results showed that this approach can produce significant new knowledge while avoiding typical issues of LCP analysis.

## Conclusion

Least-cost path analysis has been successfully applied to various archaeological contexts to understand regional road or causeway networks. By modeling the most efficient routes between paired earthwork complexes, researchers can gain insights into the organization and structure of ancient societies. This method can be used to study the relationships between sites, trade routes, and communication systems.
