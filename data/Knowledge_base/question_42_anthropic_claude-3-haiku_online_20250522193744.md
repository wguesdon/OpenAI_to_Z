# Integrating Indigenous Mapping Methods in Collaborative Archaeology

## Question Restatement
How have recent collaborative archaeology projects integrated Indigenous mapping methods (e.g., oral cartography)?

## Overview
Recent collaborative archaeology projects have increasingly incorporated Indigenous mapping methods, such as oral cartography, to better represent and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. This approach seeks to decolonize archaeology by centering Indigenous voices and shifting away from traditional Western-centric mapping practices. By integrating Indigenous mapping techniques, these projects aim to document and preserve cultural heritage, traditional land use, and place-based stories.

## Key Findings
1. **Westbank First Nation's Archaeology and Digital Heritage Project** ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9702736/](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9702736/))
   - The project partnered with the Westbank First Nation in British Columbia, Canada to develop a secure digital platform for archaeologists to interact with and use archaeological information.
   - It emphasizes the need to design digital heritage projects in accordance with Indigenous data governance principles to ensure the responsible management and safeguarding of resources.

2. **The Stz'uminus Storied Places Project** ([journals.uvic.ca/index.php/arbutus/article/download/13300/4192](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/arbutus/article/download/13300/4192))
   - This community-based digital mapping project in British Columbia, Canada aimed to document and mobilize Indigenous place names and place-based stories.
   - The project used oral cartography to capture the cultural and historical knowledge embedded in the landscape, which is crucial for preserving this knowledge as Elders pass away.

3. **Collaborative Archaeology at the Hastings Natural History Reservation** ([www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1426294/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1426294/full))
   - This project in California, USA implemented collaborative and Indigenous archaeology principles, including co-creating research questions, formalizing agreements on field and laboratory methods, and developing public engagement initiatives.
   - The project sought to center Indigenous peoples' goals, perspectives, and concerns, recognizing the multiplicity of frameworks and approaches that result from incorporating diverse perspectives.

4. **Participatory Mapping in the Upper Maroni River Basin, Northern Amazonia** ([www.academia.edu/8804341](https://www.academia.edu/8804341))
   - This participatory mapping project in Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil engaged with Indigenous Amazonian people to share research agendas and highlight the potential of interdisciplinary and multi-scalar research.
   - The project incorporated Indigenous mapping methods to document historically situated sociopolitical processes and strengthen the relationship between archaeologists and Indigenous communities.

5. **Barapa Country through Barapa Eyes: Cultural Mapping of Gunbower Island, Australia** ([www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2019.1701574](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2019.1701574))
   - This project in Australia worked with the Barapa people to develop a participatory cultural mapping of their traditional lands, particularly in relation to water resources.
   - The Gunbower Yemurriki Map was created to educate the local non-Indigenous community about Barapa cultural values and serve as a teaching aid for younger Barapa people.

## Conclusion
Recent collaborative archaeology projects have increasingly integrated Indigenous mapping methods, such as oral cartography, to better represent and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. By co-creating research agendas, formalizing agreements on field and laboratory methods, and developing public engagement initiatives, these projects aim to decolonize archaeology and ensure the responsible management and safeguarding of cultural heritage resources.
