# Soil Types Most Associated with Long-Term Human Settlements in the Amazon

**Question restated:**  
*What soil types are most associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon?*

---

## Introduction

The Amazon Basin, characterized by nutrient-poor soils and dense tropical rainforest, surprisingly hosts evidence of complex, long-term human settlements. Central to understanding these settlements is the recognition of specific soil types created or enriched by human activity that facilitated sustainable habitation and agriculture. This report explores the soil types most linked to these enduring human settlements.

## Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) or Terra Preta

### Definition and Characteristics
- Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE), also called *Terra Preta*, are anthropogenic soils enriched with organic matter, charcoal, pottery shards, and nutrients.
- These soils possess high fertility compared to surrounding naturally poor soils in the Amazon.
- They exhibit a dark, rich color due to the stable carbon content (biochar) and contain enhanced levels of phosphorus, calcium, and nitrogen.

### Significance in Long-Term Settlements
- ADEs are widely recognized as critical for supporting dense and sedentary human populations in the Amazon before European contact.
- Their fertility enabled sustainable agriculture, including staple crops like manioc (cassava).
- Archaeological evidence indicates occupation dates of ADE sites range typically from 1000 to 300 calibrated years before present (cal BP), with some sites showing use over several thousand years ([science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8499)).

### Distribution and Formation
- ADEs are found primarily in the central and eastern Brazilian Amazon.
- They are rare near Andes settlements but widespread in riverine villages and agricultural zones.
- Formation was intentional or unintentional through repeated human activities such as disposal of organic waste, charcoal deposition from burning, and soil amendment practices ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20184-2)).

## Other Soil Types & Patterns Near Settlements

### Background Soils and Ferralsols
- Surrounding the ADEs, the Amazon is dominated by Ferralsols â€” highly weathered tropical soils that are acidic and low in nutrients.
- These soils are often infertile and not suitable for sustained agriculture without modification.
- Archaeological studies have shown settlements were commonly concentrated on ADE patches, while more temporary cultivate areas were found on ferralsols or other less fertile soils ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312005523)).

### Anthropogenic Soils and Crop Domestication
- Anthropogenic soils in the Amazon are a hallmark of the formative period of Amazonian civilization.
- These soils facilitated crop domestication, notably manioc, and were key in settlement sustainability.
- A model links the distribution of manioc varieties with the appearance of these anthropogenic soils during the first millennium AD ([dro.dur.ac.uk](http://dro.dur.ac.uk/27804/1/27804.pdf?DDD6+spks92+kswl88=)).

## Summary

- **Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE or Terra Preta):** The most significant soils associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon. They are anthropogenic, nutrient-rich, and capable of supporting intensive and sustainable agriculture.
- **Ferralsols:** Dominant natural soils but generally infertile; often surround human settlements, with humans modifying or avoiding these as primary cultivation areas.
- ADEs facilitated the dense and sedentary populations alongside staple crop cultivation and cultural development in the Amazon, highlighting the role of soil management in pre-Columbian Amazonia.

This synthesis highlights that the most defining soil types associated with long-term Amazonian settlements are anthropogenic Amazonian Dark Earths, which enabled the sustainability of human habitation in an environment otherwise marked by poor soil conditions.
