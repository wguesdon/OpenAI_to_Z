# Indigenous Oral Histories of Ancient Cities and Large Settlements
The question of what Indigenous oral histories describe ancient cities or large settlements is a complex one, with various accounts across different regions.

## Introduction

Indigenous oral histories provide valuable insights into the lives and cultures of ancient civilizations. These histories often describe the origins, development, and decline of cities and large settlements.

## Examples of Ancient Cities and Settlements

Several Indigenous oral histories describe ancient cities and large settlements, including:

### Cahokia

* The city of Cahokia, located near modern-day St. Louis, Missouri, is said to have been founded by leaders who promised a spiritual and cultural rebirth [sciencefriday.com](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/cahokia-native-american-city/).
* The Cahokians built massive earthworks and stone monuments, and their city was likely the result of a social movement that swept across the US south and Midwest.

### Chaco Canyon

* In Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, the people built Pueblo Bonito, a large structure with 800 rooms, which was the largest building in North America until the 1800s [theindy.org](https://www.theindy.org/article/809).
* The Chaco culture was known for its sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, which was tied to agricultural cycles and other endeavors.

### Mesa Verde

* The Ancestral Pueblo people of Mesa Verde, Colorado, built elaborate cliff dwellings and mesa-top sites, which were abandoned in the 14th century [hcn.org](https://www.hcn.org/issues/49-17/features-archaeology-indigenous-knowledge-untangles-the-mystery-of-mesa-verde/).
* The oral histories of the Ancestral Pueblo people describe a complex and often violent history, including massacres and cannibalism.

### Triquet Island

* In British Columbia, Canada, the Heiltsuk Nation has shared oral histories with archaeologists, which have helped to identify sites like Triquet Island as being over 14,000 years old [theworld.org](https://theworld.org/stories/2017/04/21/oral-history-14000-year-old-archaeological-discovery).
* The Heiltsuk Nation's oral histories have provided new evidence of their long-standing presence in the region.

## Conclusion

Indigenous oral histories provide a wealth of information about ancient cities and large settlements. These histories often describe complex societies, sophisticated knowledge systems, and deep connections to the land.
