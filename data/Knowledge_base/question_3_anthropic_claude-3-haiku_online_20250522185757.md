# Identifying Archaeological Features Under Forest Canopy Using Machine Learning

## Question
What machine learning models have successfully identified archaeological features beneath forest canopy?

## Summary
The research reviewed in this report highlights several successful applications of machine learning and remote sensing techniques, particularly airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), for detecting archaeological features under forest canopies:

1. [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/potential-of-airborne-lidar-for-detection-of-archaeological-features-under-woodland-canopies/6224202F4EF4CE1C80924904B84B180B) - This study demonstrates the potential of LiDAR for detecting archaeological features in wooded areas, opening up a new era in archaeological survey.

2. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307001252) - This research shows that full-waveform airborne laser scanning can be an important tool for systematic archaeological prospection in vegetated areas, though there are some limitations.

3. [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/3/72) - This study used LiDAR data from the National Geographic Institute of Spain to detect an ancient fortress (El Viandar Castle) and its surrounding settlement under a dense Mediterranean forest canopy.

4. [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2019.1677424) - The researchers compared the performance of low-resolution and high-resolution LiDAR data for detecting cultural remains in the boreal forests of Sweden, finding that the high-resolution data detected about three times as many features.

5. [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/20/4181/pdf) - This research combined a hybrid machine learning approach using multispectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and LiDAR data to detect nearly 10,000 archaeological tumuli in north-western Iberia.

These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LiDAR in combination with various machine learning techniques for identifying archaeological features under forest canopies, overcoming the limitations of traditional ground-based surveys in these environments.
