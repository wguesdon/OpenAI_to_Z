# Report on Public Multispectral Satellite Data for the Target Region

## Question Restated
**What public multispectral satellite data exists for the target region?**

---

## Introduction
Multispectral satellite data is essential for numerous applications including environmental monitoring, land use mapping, agriculture, and water resource management. Various public satellite programs offer multispectral data covering global regions, including many target regions of interest. Below is an overview of well-known public multispectral satellite data sources relevant for your target region.

## Key Public Multispectral Satellite Data Sources

### 1. Sentinel-2 (Copernicus Programme)
- **Operator:** European Space Agency (ESA) under the Copernicus Programme.
- **Satellites:** Sentinel-2A (launched June 23, 2015), Sentinel-2B (launched March 7, 2017), with continuation via Sentinel-2C and 2D in the future.
- **Spatial Resolution:** High spatial resolution with multiple bands ranging from visible to shortwave infrared.
- **Swath Width:** Wide-swath imaging allowing broad coverage.
- **Temporal Resolution:** Revisit time approximately 5 days at the equator with both satellites working together.
- **Spectral Bands:** 13 spectral bands including visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared.
- **Applications:** Land vegetation monitoring, soil and water cover analysis, inland waterways, coastal area monitoring.
- **Data Accessibility:** Open and freely downloadable globally.
- **Additional Info:** The mission is supported by a predefined observation plan, optimized for operational land services.

### 2. Landsat Missions
- **Operator:** United States Geological Survey (USGS) with NASA cooperation.
- **Satellites:** Various Landsat satellites operational since 1972; current data mostly from Landsat 8 and the recently launched Landsat 9.
- **Spatial Resolution:** Multispectral bands at 30 meters spatial resolution.
- **Spectral Bands:** Visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared among others.
- **Temporal Resolution:** Approximately 16-day revisit cycle per satellite; revisit frequency increases with multiple satellites in operation.
- **Applications:** Broad earth observation including agriculture, forestry, land cover, and water monitoring.
- **Data Accessibility:** Freely available worldwide.

### 3. EO-1 Hyperion (Earth Observing One)
- **Operator:** USGS and NASA.
- **Instrument:** Hyperion hyperspectral sensor.
- **Spatial Resolution:** Approximately 30 meters.
- **Spectral Range:** Hyperspectral with 220 bands from visible to shortwave infrared covering a broader range than typical multispectral sensors.
- **Scene Size:** Standard scene length is about 42 km, extended mode up to 185 km.
- **Status:** Mission ended, but archive data remain accessible.
- **Applications:** Detailed spectral analysis such as mineralogy, vegetation types, and water quality studies.
- **Data Accessibility:** Archived data is accessible; some scenes may have gaps.

## Conclusion
For public multispectral data covering your target region, the best options currently are:

- **Sentinel-2**: Offers high spatial and temporal resolution with broad spectral coverage optimized for land and coastal monitoring.
- **Landsat**: Provides long-term historical data and consistent global coverage suitable for many earth science applications.
- **EO-1 Hyperion**: Offers detailed hyperspectral data via archives, useful for specialized studies.

These datasets are freely available to the public through portals like USGS EROS Center and the Copernicus Sentinel Online platforms.
