# Magnetic Mapping of Fluvial Deposits: Identifying Untested Anomalies

## Question
Which hydro-geomorphic settings (levees, scroll bars, ancient levee breaches) display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies?

## Introduction
The web search results provide insights into the use of magnetic mapping techniques to study fluvial deposits and associated features such as levees, scroll bars, and ancient levee breaches. The key findings from the search results are summarized below.

## Magnetic Mapping of Fluvial Deposits
The search results highlight the following key points:

- High-resolution, low-level aeromagnetic surveys can map the distribution of magnetic minerals in alluvial cover, revealing linear anomalies with a dendritic pattern typical of drainage systems.
- These magnetic anomalies are not evident in regional aeromagnetic data with wider line spacing and higher elevation.
- Combining high-resolution magnetic data with mapping of present-day drainage is an important input for gold exploration in the area.
- Modeling and inversion of the magnetic anomalies could provide quantitative information to target and evaluate gold resources, but further sampling and statistical analysis are required.

- The study investigates the genesis of magnetic anomalies in the floodplains of the Fossa Carolina, an early medieval canal project in Germany.
- Magnetic investigations can provide insights into the physical properties of archaeological sediments in floodplain wetlands.

- Geophysical and geotechnical methods are complementary in assessing the condition and stability of fluvial levees.
- Geophysical methods, such as EM surveys, can provide regional, continuous coverage to identify high-risk areas that require further investigation.

- Airborne EM surveys, in conjunction with other ground-based methods, can be used to provide a comprehensive picture of the subsurface conditions of levee foundations, including the horizontal extent of sand channels.

## Identifying Untested Magnetic Anomalies
Based on the information provided in the search results, it appears that the studies focus on the general application of magnetic mapping techniques to fluvial deposits and associated features, rather than providing a direct comparison of the proportion of untested anomalies across different hydro-geomorphic settings (levees, scroll bars, ancient levee breaches).

The search results suggest that magnetic anomalies are more likely to be detected in fluvial environments using high-resolution, low-level aeromagnetic surveys compared to regional, higher-altitude surveys. However, the specific proportion of untested anomalies in different hydro-geomorphic settings is not directly addressed.

To answer this question, further research would be needed that specifically compares the occurrence and testing of magnetic anomalies across different fluvial features, such as levees, scroll bars, and ancient levee breaches.

## Conclusion
The web search results provide valuable insights into the use of magnetic mapping techniques to study fluvial deposits and associated features, but do not directly address the question of which hydro-geomorphic settings display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies. Additional research would be required to make a direct comparison across different fluvial features.
