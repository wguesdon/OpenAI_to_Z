# Mapping the Overlap of Anthropogenic Dark Earths and Soil Fertility in the Amazon

## Question
How do soil-fertility maps (e.g., phosphorus, organic carbon) overlap with clusters of anthropogenic dark earths?

## Introduction
Anthropogenic dark earths, also known as Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) or terra preta, are carbon-rich soils found in the Amazon basin that were intentionally created by pre-Columbian Amazonian societies. These soils are characterized by high levels of organic matter, nutrients, and anthropogenic charcoal, and are often associated with increased agricultural productivity and biodiversity compared to surrounding soils.

Understanding the spatial relationship between the distribution of ADEs and soil fertility indicators, such as phosphorus and organic carbon, can provide insights into the historical land management practices of Amazonian peoples and the potential for these soils to serve as a model for sustainable agriculture and soil restoration in the region.

## Mapping the Overlap
Several studies have explored the spatial distribution of ADEs and their relationship to soil fertility indicators:

[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon) provides a map of the distribution of archaeological sites in the Uatumã river region of the Brazilian Amazon, which shows clusters of ADE sites. This suggests that ADEs were intentionally created in certain areas, potentially indicating higher soil fertility in those locations.

[science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8499) demonstrates spatial and compositional similarities between ancient and modern dark earth, and documents modern Indigenous practices that enrich soil. This supports the idea that ancient Amazonians managed soil to improve fertility and increase crop productivity, which also sequestered and stored carbon in the soil for centuries.

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001670611930535X) found that ADE sites in the Brazilian Amazon are characterized by elemental enrichment, with elements such as phosphorus, potassium, and calcium being up to 15.9 times more concentrated in ADEs compared to surrounding soils. This suggests a strong overlap between the distribution of ADEs and areas of higher soil fertility.

[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1172406/full) discusses the spatial correlation between anthropogenic forests and anthropic soils (ADEs) in the Caxiuanã National Forest in Brazil, indicating that the vegetation structure and productivity in these areas are influenced by the altered soil properties.

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706121001464) found that ADEs in the Amazon generally have higher levels of available micronutrients, such as manganese and zinc, compared to adjacent soils, especially in the top 30 cm. This further suggests a strong overlap between ADE distribution and areas of enhanced soil fertility.

## Conclusion
The available research indicates a robust spatial overlap between the distribution of anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) and areas of enhanced soil fertility, as measured by indicators such as phosphorus, organic carbon, and micronutrient availability. This suggests that the intentional creation and management of these carbon-rich soils by pre-Columbian Amazonian societies was a key factor in maintaining the region's agricultural productivity and ecological resilience. Understanding these historical land management practices may provide valuable insights for developing sustainable agriculture and soil restoration strategies in the Amazon and other tropical regions.
