# Cross-Validating Text-Mined Colonial Sources with Living Oral Traditions
## Introduction

The quest to accurately identify site locations is a crucial aspect of historical and archaeological research. However, colonial sources often present conflicting information, which can be challenging to resolve. One approach to addressing this issue is to cross-validate text-mined colonial sources against living oral traditions. This method offers a promising way to reconcile discrepancies and gain a more nuanced understanding of the past.

## The Importance of Oral Traditions

Oral traditions provide a valuable source of information about historical settings dating back far in time [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/ancient-history-in-the-new-world-integrating-oral-traditions-and-the-archaeological-record-in-deep-time/12072E85021CA38FC35E66C5DCB69469). The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) recognizes oral traditions as a source of evidence that must be considered by museum and federal agency officials in making findings of cultural affiliation between ancient and modern Native American communities.

## Integrating Oral Traditions with Archaeological Records

Studies have shown that oral records and archaeological records describe a shared past and should be viewed as natural partners in post-NAGPRA America [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/ancient-history-in-the-new-world-integrating-oral-traditions-and-the-archaeological-record-in-deep-time/12072E85021CA38FC35E66C5DCB69469). By integrating oral traditions with archaeological records, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of historical events and site locations.

## Symmetrical Analysis of Epistemic Cultures

Actor-network theory can be used to ethnographically compare the epistemic cultures of both scientists and indigenous communities [sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0539018419830333). This approach highlights the importance of recognizing the equal value of different forms of knowledge and challenges the dominant Western epistemological framework.

## Case Studies and Applications

Several case studies demonstrate the successful application of cross-validating text-mined colonial sources with living oral traditions [sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/9X0V-4K6P-3LFK-4NVL). For example, historical archaeologists have worked with oral historians to merge their approaches and produce a better understanding of the past.

## Resolving Conflicting Site Locations

To resolve conflicting site locations, researchers can follow these steps:

1. **Text-mining colonial sources**: Analyze colonial documents to identify potential site locations.
2. **Collecting oral traditions**: Work with indigenous communities to collect and document their oral traditions related to site locations.
3. **Integrating oral and written records**: Compare and integrate the information from oral traditions and colonial sources to identify potential discrepancies.
4. **Symmetrical analysis**: Apply actor-network theory to analyze the epistemic cultures of both scientists and indigenous communities.
5. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validate the information from oral traditions and colonial sources to resolve conflicting site locations.

## Conclusion

Cross-validating text-mined colonial sources with living oral traditions offers a promising approach to resolving conflicting site locations. By recognizing the value of oral traditions and integrating them with archaeological records, researchers can gain a more nuanced understanding of the past. This approach requires a symmetrical analysis of epistemic cultures and a willingness to challenge dominant Western epistemological frameworks.
