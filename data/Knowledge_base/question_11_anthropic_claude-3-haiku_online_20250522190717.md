## Comprehensive Report on Open Archaeological Databases Containing Verified Site Locations in the Amazon

### Question
Are there any open archaeological databases containing verified site locations in the Amazon?

### Summary
The search results indicate that there are a few open archaeological databases that contain information on archaeological sites in the Amazon region, but the coverage and level of verification of the data varies.

The key findings are:

1. [Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA)](https://opencontext.org/projects/d75ef68a-0e23-458c-976d-286d83c13013): This database provides summary data on the occurrence of Paleoindian projectile points across the Americas, including the Amazon region. However, the database focuses more on North America and the level of data verification for Amazon sites is unclear.

2. [The Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene archaeological record in Brazil: A geo-referenced database](https://www.academia.edu/11548691/The_Late_Pleistocene_Early_Holocene_archaeological_record_in_Brazil_A_geo_referenced_database): This database, published in a research paper, compiles data on 63 archaeological sites in Brazil with evidence of human presence dating back to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The data is geo-referenced and the authors aimed to increase the accuracy and precision of the information.

3. [Contribución para un primer inventario general de sitios arqueológicos del Perú](https://repositorio.cultura.gob.pe/handle/CULTURA/85): This is a repository hosted by the Peruvian Ministry of Culture that contains a general inventory of archaeological sites in Peru, which includes some sites located in the Amazonian region of Peru.

4. [SIGDA](https://sigda.cultura.gob.pe/): The Peruvian Ministry of Culture also hosts this Geospatial Archaeological Information System (SIGDA), which contains information on archaeological sites in Peru, including the Amazon region. However, the data is noted to be of a referential nature and not a substitute for technical or legal opinions.

In summary, while there are some open archaeological databases that cover the Amazon region, the comprehensiveness and level of verification of the data vary. Further research and collaboration may be needed to develop a more comprehensive and reliable open database of archaeological sites in the Amazon.
