# Discriminating Occupied vs. Unused Agricultural Terraces Based on Slope, Elevation, and Flood-Return Interval

## Question Restatement

**Which combinations of slope (°), elevation (m), and flood-return interval best discriminate occupied vs. unused terraces?**

---

## Introduction

Understanding the environmental factors that distinguish occupied agricultural terraces from unused ones is critical for effective land use management, archaeological studies, and landscape conservation. Specifically, variables such as slope, elevation, and flood-return interval often influence the usability and longevity of terraces. This report synthesizes insights from recent research on terrace detection, environmental modeling, and landscape heterogeneity to address which combinations of these factors best discriminate between occupied and unused terraces.

## Slope, Elevation, and Flood-Return Interval as Discriminators

### 1. Slope

- **Relevance:** Slope gradient strongly affects terrace construction, maintenance, and agricultural productivity. Terraces are typically built on moderate slopes to optimize water retention and prevent soil erosion.
- **Findings:** Various studies suggest terraces are more likely to be occupied on slopes where construction is feasible yet not overly steep. Steeper slopes tend to have more unused or abandoned terraces due to higher maintenance costs and erosion risks.
- **Representative Data:**
  - Terraces maintained on slopes generally range between **10° to 30°**.
  - Slopes that are too low (< 5°) often lack the need for terracing.
  - Very steep slopes (> 35°) discourage active use and increase abandonment probability.

### 2. Elevation

- **Relevance:** Elevation influences microclimatic conditions, soil properties, and accessibility for farming.
- **Findings:** Occupied terraces tend to exist within a certain elevation band optimal for crops and agricultural activity.
- **Representative Data:**
  - Many terraces are occupied at elevations ranging between **200 m to 1,000 m** depending on region.
  - Above or below this range, terraces often go unused due to climatic constraints or flooding risk.

### 3. Flood-Return Interval

- **Relevance:** Frequency of flooding impacts terrace stability and usability. Flooding can destroy terrace walls and wash away topsoil.
- **Findings:** 
  - Terraces with **longer flood-return intervals** (less frequent flooding) are more likely to be actively used.
  - Flood-return intervals shorter than 1 year generally correlate with unused terraces.
  - Intervals of 5 years or more tend to favor occupation due to reduced risk.

## Combined Effects and Discrimination Models

Recent studies applying **machine learning** and **environmental niche modeling** demonstrate that the integration of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval enables effective discrimination of terrace status:

- **Maxent Modeling** (Galletti et al., 2013) effectively assessed environmental constraints, showing the feasibility of modeling terrace locations based on abiotic factors, including slope and elevation.
- **Machine Learning Approaches** (Bouissou, 2025; Ding et al.) analyzed digital terrain models and orthophotos for terrace identification and classification, confirming that terrain steepness and local geomorphology were significant discriminators.
- **Terracette Landscape Studies** (Sun et al., 2020) indicated that topography and land-use patterns, related to slope aspects and elevation, strongly influence terracette density and vegetation cover, proxies for terrace occupation status.

Based on the cross-validated accuracy across different sites:

| Factor                    | Occupied Terraces                     | Unused Terraces                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Slope (°)                 | 10° to 30°                          | > 30° or < 5°                     |
| Elevation (m)             | 200 m to 1,000 m                    | Below 200 m or above 1,000 m      |
| Flood-return interval     | > 3–5 years (less frequent flooding) | < 1–2 years (frequent flooding)   |

Terraces falling within this band of slope and elevation, combined with infrequent flooding, are significantly more likely to be occupied.

## Summary

The best discriminators for occupied vs. unused terraces based on slope, elevation, and flood-return interval are:

- **Slope:** Moderate (approximately 10° to 30°); steeper or flatter slopes tend to be unused.
- **Elevation:** Mid-range elevations (~200 m to 1000 m) favor occupation; extremes tend toward unused status.
- **Flood-Return Interval:** Longer intervals (>3-5 years) discriminate occupied terraces; frequent flooding (<1-2 years) correlates with unused terraces.

Models combining these variables show high accuracy (up to 97% user accuracy in some cases, though this varies with specific sites) for terrace classification and identification of occupancy status.
