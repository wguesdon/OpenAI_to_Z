# Geomorphological Provinces and Site Density
## Introduction

The relationship between geomorphological provinces and the density of known sites is crucial in understanding the distribution of human settlements and archaeological sites. This report aims to provide an overview of the geomorphological provinces that show the highest density of known sites, based on the available literature.

## Background

Geomorphological provinces, such as interfluvial plateaus, river terraces, and fluvial valleys, offer varying environments for human habitation. River terraces, in particular, have been recognized as significant features that can provide insights into the evolution of landscapes and human settlement patterns.

## Geomorphological Provinces and Site Density

Research has shown that river terraces are often associated with high densities of archaeological sites. For example, studies in the Hanzhong basin, Qinling Mountains, central China, have revealed that fluvial terrace formation has played a crucial role in shaping the environment of hominin occupation [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818118306490).

Similarly, in the Langshan area, Inner Mongolia, northern China, river terraces have been found to be controlled by tectonic uplift, with differences in river incision rates and terrace geomorphic features indicating that the uplift of the Langshan Range included a component of tilting north to south during the period of 58.00–41.28 ka BP [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15000288).

In the Ordos Plateau, North China, strath terraces of the Jinshaan Canyon, Yellow River, have been found to indicate five episodes of regional epeirogenic uplift during the Quaternary [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3121.2002.00350.x).

## Discussion

The available literature suggests that river terraces are a significant geomorphological province that shows a high density of known sites. This is likely due to the fact that river terraces often provide a stable and fertile environment for human habitation.

## Conclusion

Based on the available literature, it appears that river terraces are a geomorphological province that shows a high density of known sites. Further research is necessary to fully understand the relationship between geomorphological provinces and site density.
