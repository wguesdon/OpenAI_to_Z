# Open-Access LIDAR Datasets Covering Portions of the Brazilian Amazon
The question of open-access LIDAR datasets covering portions of the Brazilian Amazon is crucial for understanding the dynamics of this vast and ecologically significant region. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data provides high-resolution information about the Earth's surface, including vegetation height, biomass, and changes over time.

## Introduction
The Brazilian Amazon is a vast region that spans a significant portion of South America, encompassing a wide range of ecosystems, including rainforests, savannas, and wetlands. The region is of great interest for scientific research, conservation efforts, and sustainable development. LIDAR data has become an essential tool for studying the Earth's surface, offering detailed insights into vegetation structure, biomass, and dynamics.

## Available LIDAR Datasets
Several open-access LIDAR datasets cover portions of the Brazilian Amazon, providing valuable information for research and applications:

### 1. Forest Inventory and Biophysical Measurements, Brazilian Amazon, 2009-2018
[daac.ornl.gov](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=2007) provides a comprehensive dataset that includes measurements for diameter at breast height (DBH), commercial tree height, and total tree height for forest inventories. This dataset also includes family, common and scientific names, coordinates, canopy position, crown radius, and decomposition status for dead trees. Aboveground biomass estimates are available for selected sites.

### 2. Large-scale Variations in the Dynamics of Amazon Forest Canopy Gaps
[www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80809-w?error=cookies_not_supported&code=41acff0c-cef5-4442-811f-ef777d6bf35a) presents research on the dynamics of Amazon forest canopy gaps using airborne LIDAR data. The study highlights the importance of LIDAR data in understanding gap dynamics and tree mortality at a large scale in the Amazon.

### 3. Lowland Amazon Basin
[daac.ornl.gov](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1284) offers a dataset that provides a map of wetland extent, vegetation type, and dual-season flooding state of the entire lowland Amazon basin. This dataset was derived from the Global Rain Forest Mapping Project (GRFM) Amazon mosaics acquired during 1995 and 1996.

### 4. Monitoring Selective Logging in Western Amazonia with Repeat Lidar Flights
[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425713003441) discusses the use of repeat LIDAR flights to monitor selective logging in western Amazonia. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of LIDAR data in tracking changes in forest structure and biomass due to logging activities.

### 5. Estimating Forest Biomass and Identifying Low-Intensity Logging Areas
[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712002179) presents research on estimating forest biomass and identifying areas disturbed by selective logging using airborne LIDAR data in the Antimary State Forest, Acre State, Western Brazilian Amazon.

## Conclusion
These open-access LIDAR datasets provide valuable resources for researchers, conservationists, and policymakers interested in understanding the dynamics of the Brazilian Amazon. By leveraging these datasets, it is possible to gain insights into forest structure, biomass, and changes over time, ultimately informing efforts to conserve and sustainably manage this critical region.
