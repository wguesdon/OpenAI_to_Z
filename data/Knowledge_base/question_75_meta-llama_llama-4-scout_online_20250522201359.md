# Hydro-Geomorphic Settings with Untested Magnetic Anomalies
## Introduction

The question pertains to the identification of hydro-geomorphic settings that display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies. This involves analyzing various settings such as levees, scroll bars, and ancient levee breaches in the context of magnetic anomalies.

## Restatement of the Question

Which hydro-geomorphic settings (levees, scroll bars, ancient levee breaches) display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies?

## Relevant Studies

Several studies have investigated the relationship between hydro-geomorphic settings and magnetic anomalies. For instance, [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1071/ASEG2015ab189) discusses the use of magnetic mapping to identify river channel and palaeochannel deposits in the Teetulpa gold field, South Australia. This study highlights the potential of magnetic anomalies in targeting and evaluating gold resources.

Similarly, [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/arp.1761) examines the genesis of magnetic anomalies in floodplain wetlands of the Fossa Carolina, providing insights into the magnetic properties of archaeological sediments.

## Analysis of Hydro-Geomorphic Settings

* **Levees**: Levees are natural or artificial barriers that run along rivers or coastlines, designed to prevent flooding. Research has shown that levees can exhibit magnetic anomalies due to the presence of magnetic minerals in the sediments [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013795218304903). However, the proportion of untested magnetic anomalies in levees is not well documented.
* **Scroll Bars**: Scroll bars are depositional features formed by the migration of meandering rivers. They can exhibit magnetic anomalies due to the presence of magnetic minerals in the sediments. A study by [seg.org](https://chooser.crossref.org/?doi=10.1190%2F1.1440559) demonstrates the use of magnetometers in locating present and prior stream beds, which can be related to scroll bars.
* **Ancient Levee Breaches**: Ancient levee breaches can also display magnetic anomalies due to the presence of magnetic minerals in the sediments. A study by [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1761) provides insights into the magnetic properties of archaeological sediments in floodplain wetlands, which can be related to ancient levee breaches.

## Conclusion

Based on the available research, it appears that ancient levee breaches and scroll bars may display a higher proportion of untested magnetic anomalies compared to levees. However, further research is needed to confirm this conclusion and provide a more detailed analysis of the relationship between hydro-geomorphic settings and magnetic anomalies.
