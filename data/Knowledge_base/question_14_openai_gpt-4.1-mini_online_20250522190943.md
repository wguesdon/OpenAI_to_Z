# Public Platforms Curating Indigenous Territorial Boundaries and Ethno-Linguistic Data Layers

**Question:**  
*Which public platforms curate Indigenous territorial boundaries and ethno-linguistic data layers?*

## Introduction

Understanding and mapping Indigenous territorial boundaries and ethno-linguistic data is vital for recognizing Indigenous peoples, their histories, governance, and cultural diversity. Several public platforms have emerged to curate and provide access to such spatial and cultural information. These platforms serve as educational tools, resources for scholars, and supports for Indigenous communities themselves.

## Important Notes

- These platforms generally do **not claim to represent official or legally binding boundaries** but rather aim to visualize Indigenous territories and language areas, often based on historical knowledge, community contributions, and ethnographic research.
- For definitive legal boundaries, the platforms recommend direct contact with Indigenous nations.
- The maps are dynamic documents reflecting ongoing community engagement.
