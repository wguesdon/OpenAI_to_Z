# Locations of Suspected but Unconfirmed Archaeological Sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest

**Question:**  
*What are the locations of suspected archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest from the literature that have not yet been confirmed?*

---

## Introduction

The Brazilian Amazon Rainforest has been a focus of extensive archaeological research revealing numerous Pre-Columbian sites such as earthworks, ditched enclosures, and other forms of settlements. However, alongside these confirmed locations, there are many suspected archaeological sites noted in the literature that are yet to be systematically confirmed through fieldwork or sufficient empirical data.

Recent advances in methods such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and machine learning have expanded the ability to identify potential archaeological sites submerged by dense forest or otherwise difficult to access terrain. Still, a gap remains between modeled or suspected sites and those definitively confirmed and documented.

## Overview of Suspected Archaeological Site Locations

### 1. Tapajós National Forest and Upland Areas near Santarém

- **Location:** Belterra Plateau and Tapajós National Forest (Flona-Tapajós), south of Santarém, Brazil.
- **Significance:** LiDAR data revealed a pattern of non-randomly distributed depressions or cavities called "Poços de Água," suggesting an extension of human settlement farther south than previously established by traditional fieldwork.
- **Status:** These sites have been identified as probable ancient human settlements but remain largely unconfirmed archaeologically beyond remote sensing evidence.  
- **References:**  
  - Stenborg et al. (2018) highlight these suspected settlements based on LiDAR data showing settlement patterns deep into dense forested areas [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1417198).

### 2. Southern Amazonia Headwaters of the Tapajós River

- **Location:** The region around the Tapajós River headwaters in the southern Amazon.
- **Significance:** Discoveries of Pre-Columbian ditched enclosures indicated presence of fortified villages attributable to earth-building cultures (circa AD 1250-1500). Spatial gaps suggest that many related sites in adjacent areas remain undocumented or unconfirmed.
- **Status:** Many additional potential earthwork sites predicted by models are suspected over approximately 400,000 km² but have yet to be confirmed with archaeological excavation.
- **References:**  
  - Gregorio de Souza et al. (2018) emphasize the extent of suspected yet unconfirmed earthwork settlements along an 1800 km stretch of southern Amazonia [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29588444/).

### 3. Upper Purús River Region in Western Amazonia

- **Location:** Upper Purús River area in western Amazonia.
- **Significance:** Geometric earthworks and geoglyphs indicative of complex societies were discovered here, but many suspected earthworks with similar features remain to be formally identified and studied.
- **Status:** Several sites, including potential geometric earthworks or geoglyphs, are documented but not fully confirmed or understood regarding extent and function.
- **References:**  
  - Pärssinen et al. (2009) discuss pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in this region, noting that the cultural landscape likely encompasses more unconfirmed sites [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/precolumbian-geometric-earthworks-in-the-upper-purus-a-complex-society-in-western-amazonia/CF5DB06F57758F24C32449BD4B2C5AFB).

### 4. Various Locations in the Outer Peruvian Amazon (Relevant to Brazilian Amazon Border Areas)

- **Location:** Various scattered sites in the Peruvian Amazon; implications extend to the western fringes of the Brazilian Amazon.
- **Significance:** Hundreds of unpublished sites documented in the Peruvian Amazon challenge the idea of sparse early human presence; similar unknown sites likely exist in adjacent Brazilian territory.
- **Status:** Many sites are based on literature review and limited data, pending confirmation or excavation.
- **References:**  
  - Documentation and geolocations compiled by recent studies provide hints about a larger number of suspected sites [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7.pdf).

### 5. Broad Geographic Distributions Predicted by Machine Learning

- **Location:** Grid cells across the Amazon showing probabilities for earthworks, Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs), and other archaeological sites.
- **Significance:** Machine learning models predict a widespread pattern of archaeological site locations across various parts of the Amazon Basin, including substantial areas where no formal confirmation has yet occurred.
- **Status:** Many predicted site locations await verification by field archaeology.
- **References:**  
  - Walker (2023) presents models delineating potential spatial distributions of various site types, highlighting areas with little sampled ground truth [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/).

## Conclusion

Although substantial progress has been made in identifying confirmed archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon, a considerable number of suspected sites remain unconfirmed. These locations span upland plateaus, forests, river headwaters, and vast swathes of the rainforest predicted by both remote sensing and computational modeling. Future archaeological surveys, excavations, and interdisciplinary studies are necessary to validate these suspected sites and enrich understanding of Pre-Columbian Amazonian human history.
