# Current State of the Art for Detecting Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Forest using Satellite or Aerial Images
====================================================================================

## Introduction

The Amazon Forest is a vast and remote region, making it challenging to detect and study archaeological sites using traditional methods. However, with the advancement of satellite and aerial imaging technologies, researchers have been able to identify and analyze archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest more efficiently. This report provides an overview of the current state of the art for detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest using satellite or aerial images.

## Methods

Several methods have been employed to detect archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest using satellite or aerial images, including:

### LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Data

LiDAR data has been widely used to detect archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest. [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1417198) used LiDAR data to identify pre-Columbian settlements in the Santarém Region, Lower Amazon. The study found that LiDAR data can reveal hidden structures and patterns in the landscape, allowing researchers to identify archaeological sites that would have been difficult to detect using traditional methods.

### Multispectral Satellite Imagery

Multispectral satellite imagery has also been used to detect archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418304410) used multispectral satellite imagery and UAV data to detect buried archaeological remains. The study found that the combined use of satellite multispectral data and UAV data can be effective in detecting buried archaeological remains.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites. [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/) used machine learning algorithms to predict the distribution of earthworks, ADEs, and other non-earthwork/non-ADE sites in the Amazon Forest. The study found that the use of machine learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of predictions and provide insights into the geographic distribution of archaeological sites.

### Aerial Photography

Aerial photography has been used to detect archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418304410) used aerial photography to detect earthworks as shadow-marks.

## Case Studies

Several case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using satellite or aerial images to detect archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest. For example:

* [science.org](https://www.science.org/content/article/laser-mapping-reveals-hidden-structures-in-amazon-hints-thousands-more) used LiDAR data to identify hidden structures in the Amazon Forest, hinting at the presence of thousands more archaeological sites.
* [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-170.pdf) used remote sensing technology with Landsat satellite sensors to track isolated indigenous populations and locate uncontacted indigenous villages in Amazonia.

## Conclusion

The current state of the art for detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest using satellite or aerial images involves the use of LiDAR data, multispectral satellite imagery, machine learning algorithms, and aerial photography. These methods have been used to identify and analyze archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest, providing insights into the geographic distribution of ancient human settlements. Future research should focus on improving the accuracy of predictions and exploring new methods for detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest.
