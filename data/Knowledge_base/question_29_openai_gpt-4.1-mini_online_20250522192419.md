## Overview of "Z"

The term "Z" was used by Fawcett to designate a mythical or lost ancient city deep in the Amazon. Fawcett hypothesized that "Z" represented a remnant of a highly developed civilization predating European contact with South America.

### Origin of the Concept

- Fawcett's notion of "Z" originated from both his own observations and interpretations of indigenous legends and early maps of the Amazon region.
- He believed the city had architectural ruins and advanced culture, based on river patterns and indigenous tales.
- His extensive correspondence outlines his conviction that exploring the jungle would uncover this lost city.

### Evidence in Journals and Letters

Percy Fawcett's journals and correspondence, as archived in collections such as those at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, contain various references to "Z" including:

- **Descriptions of terrain and geography** surrounding where he believed "Z" lay, often citing rivers, plains, and unexplored jungle areas.
- **Indigenous accounts**: Fawcett cited local native informants who spoke of ruins and cities ruled by ancient peoples, lending credibility to his assumptions about "Z."
- **Maps and sketches**: He recorded maps or hypothetical locations of "Z" that directed his expeditions.
- **Philosophical and speculative notes** on the nature of the civilization that might have constructed "Z," frequently reflecting his fascination with lost civilizations and perhaps influenced by Theosophical ideas.
