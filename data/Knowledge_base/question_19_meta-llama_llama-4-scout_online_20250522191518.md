# Dating Techniques Used to Establish Chronologies for Known Amazon Sites
## Introduction

The Amazon region has a rich cultural and archaeological heritage, with numerous sites providing valuable insights into the lives of pre-Columbian societies. Establishing chronologies for these sites is essential for understanding the development and evolution of these cultures. This report will discuss the dating techniques used to establish chronologies for known Amazon sites.

## Dating Techniques

Several dating techniques have been employed to establish chronologies for Amazon sites, including:

### 1. Radiocarbon Dating

Radiocarbon dating is a widely used technique for dating organic materials. In the Amazon region, radiocarbon dating has been used to date charcoal, shell, and pottery samples. For example, a study on the earliest pottery found in the Western Hemisphere, excavated from a prehistoric shell midden near Santarém in the lower Amazon, Brazil, used calibrated accelerator radiocarbon dates on charcoal, shell, and pottery, and thermoluminescence dates on pottery [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.254.5038.1621).

### 2. Thermoluminescence (TL) Dating

Thermoluminescence dating is a technique used to date inorganic materials, such as pottery and ceramics. This technique measures the energy released when a sample is heated, which is proportional to the time elapsed since the sample was last exposed to heat or light. TL dating has been used to date pottery samples from the Hatahara archaeological site in the Amazon Valley, Brazil [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

### 3. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) Dating

Optically stimulated luminescence dating is a technique used to date inorganic materials, such as quartz and feldspar grains. This technique measures the energy released when a sample is exposed to light, which is proportional to the time elapsed since the sample was last exposed to light. OSL dating has been used in conjunction with TL and EPR dating to date pottery fragments from the Hatahara archaeological site [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

### 4. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Dating

Electron paramagnetic resonance dating is a technique used to date inorganic materials, such as quartz and feldspar grains. This technique measures the number of unpaired electrons in a sample, which is proportional to the time elapsed since the sample was last exposed to heat or light. EPR dating has been used in conjunction with TL and OSL dating to date pottery fragments from the Hatahara archaeological site [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, several dating techniques have been used to establish chronologies for known Amazon sites, including radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence dating, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and electron paramagnetic resonance dating. These techniques have provided valuable insights into the lives of pre-Columbian societies in the Amazon region.
