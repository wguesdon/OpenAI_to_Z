# Techniques for Filtering False Positives in Geometric Pattern Detection

## Summary
The question asks how to filter false positives when identifying potential geometric patterns. Based on the web search results provided, there are a few key techniques that can be used to address this issue:

1. **Geometric Property Thresholds**: Tuning the thresholds for various geometric properties of detected regions, such as bounding box expansion, can help filter out non-text regions that may be falsely detected as potential patterns.

2. **Morphological Closing and Object Sieving**: Applying morphological operations like closing and object sieving can help reduce false detections by smoothing borders, filling small holes, and removing extraneous objects.

3. **Continuity Threshold and Geometric Projection**: Using continuity thresholds and geometric projection methods can help eliminate background noise and reconstruct obscured parts of the original image, improving the accuracy of the pattern detection.

4. **Topological Clustering**: A technique called "topologically clustering" can be used to discard mismatches and improve the correct ratio of initial matches in wide baseline stereo correspondence algorithms.

## Detailed Techniques

1. **Geometric Property Thresholds**:
   - The paper "Exploring Geometric Property Thresholds For Filtering Non-Text Regions In A Connected Component Based Text Detection Application" [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.03548.pdf) discusses the use of geometric property thresholds to tune a text detection application.
   - The authors mention that certain geometric properties, such as the amount by which neighboring bounding boxes are expanded, need to be carefully tuned to process non-natural images with highly stylized, custom fonts.
   - Proper tuning of these geometric property thresholds can help filter out non-text regions that may be falsely detected as potential patterns.

2. **Morphological Closing and Object Sieving**:
   - The paper "Object sieving and morphological closing to reduce false detections in wide-area aerial imagery" [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15260v1.pdf) discusses the use of morphological operations to improve detection performance.
   - The authors mention that a technique called "filtered dilation" uses a median filter for smoothing and a dilation operator to shape the detected objects, aiming for distinct auto-detected regions with smooth borders and small holes filled.
   - This approach can help reduce false detections by improving the quality of the detected regions.

3. **Continuity Threshold and Geometric Projection**:
   - The paper "Noise elimination methods in topological pattern recognition" [spiedigitallibrary.org](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/redirect/proceedings/proceeding?doi=10.1117/12.778003) discusses the use of continuity thresholds and geometric projection methods to eliminate background noise and reconstruct obscured parts of the original image.
   - The authors claim that this approach can thoroughly eliminate background noise and accurately reconstruct the obscured parts of the original image, which can improve the accuracy of pattern detection.

4. **Topological Clustering**:
   - The paper "Topologically clustering: a method for discarding mismatches" [spiedigitallibrary.org](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/redirect/proceedings/proceeding?doi=10.1117/12.748868) discusses a technique called "topologically clustering" to discard mismatches and improve the correct ratio of initial matches in wide baseline stereo correspondence algorithms.
   - The authors suggest that getting high-quality initial matches is crucial for the success of these algorithms, and their proposed topological clustering method can help improve the performance by discarding mismatches.

## Conclusion
In summary, the key techniques for filtering false positives in geometric pattern detection include:
1. Tuning geometric property thresholds
2. Applying morphological operations like closing and sieving
3. Using continuity thresholds and geometric projection
4. Employing topological clustering to discard mismatches

By incorporating these techniques, the accuracy and reliability of geometric pattern detection can be significantly improved.
