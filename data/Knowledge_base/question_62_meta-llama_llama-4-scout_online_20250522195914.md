# Spatial Autocorrelation Between Confirmed Sites and Large Navigable Waterways

## Introduction
The question of how strong the spatial autocorrelation is between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways, specifically main stems versus secondary tributaries, can be explored through various studies on riverine ecosystems and fish populations. This report aims to synthesize findings from relevant research.

## Restatement of the Question
How strong is the spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways (main stems vs. secondary tributaries)?

## Spatial Autocorrelation in Riverine Ecosystems
Spatial autocorrelation refers to the degree to which a variable is correlated with itself across space. In the context of riverine ecosystems, it can help understand how the distribution of fish populations and their habitats are related across different parts of a river network.

## Main Stems vs. Secondary Tributaries
Research indicates that the spatial structure of large-river fish populations can vary significantly across main-stem and tributary habitats [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.3289). For instance, a study on the spatial identification of tributary impacts in river networks highlights the importance of considering the connectivity across tributary and main-stem habitats for conservation and management of large-river fish populations [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470760383.ch9).

## Influence of Spatial Positioning
The influence of spatial positioning within stream networks on fish assemblage structure is significant. A study in the Kansas River basin found that after controlling for longitude and stream size, distance from streams of 5th order or higher accounted for a small proportion of taxonomic variability. However, species richness was significantly higher, and assemblage structure differed in tributary stream segments directly connected to larger-ordered streams [nrc-prod.literatumonline.com](https://nrc-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1139/F09-169).

## Accounting for Dispersal and Local Habitat
When evaluating tributary use by riverine fishes, it's crucial to account for dispersal and local habitat. Research suggests that several mainstem rivers have undammed tributary rivers that provide access to less-impacted river channel and floodplain habitats [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.3711).

## Within-Basin Fish Assemblage Structure
The relative influence of habitat versus stream spatial position on local species richness within a basin is an important consideration. A study found that the spatial autocorrelation was only significant downstream (from 4th- to 7th-order streams), suggesting that the relative importance of local habitat and biotic processes changes across different stream orders [nrc-prod.literatumonline.com](https://nrc-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1139/f03-145).

## Conclusion
The spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways, specifically main stems versus secondary tributaries, is influenced by various factors including habitat, stream spatial position, and connectivity across tributary and main-stem habitats. While specific autocorrelation values are not directly provided in the reviewed studies, the evidence suggests that there is a significant relationship between spatial positioning within river networks and fish assemblage structure.
