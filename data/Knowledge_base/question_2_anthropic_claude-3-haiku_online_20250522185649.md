# Detecting Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Forest using Satellite and Aerial Imagery

## Question
What is the current state of the art for detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest using satellite or aerial images?

## Summary
The current state of the art for detecting archaeological sites in the Amazon Forest using satellite and aerial imagery involves the use of a variety of remote sensing techniques, including:

1. **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: LiDAR data has proven to be a powerful tool for detecting and mapping archaeological features in the Amazon, as it can penetrate dense vegetation and reveal previously unknown earthworks, settlements, and other structures.

2. **Multispectral Satellite Imagery**: Satellite-based multispectral imaging can help identify vegetation and soil signatures that may indicate the presence of buried archaeological remains.

3. **Aerial Photography**: Oblique aerial photography, particularly when combined with LiDAR data, can be used to detect and map visible earthworks and other surface features.

4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Researchers are increasingly using machine learning techniques to analyze remote sensing data and predict the geographic distribution of archaeological sites, allowing for more comprehensive and efficient surveys.

The research highlights that these remote sensing approaches, when used in combination, can significantly expand the known limits of late pre-Columbian human settlement in the Amazon, leading to the discovery of numerous previously unknown archaeological sites.

## Detailed Findings

### LiDAR Data Reveals Extensive Pre-Columbian Settlement
[Stenborg et al. (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1417198) used LiDAR data to discover that pre-Columbian settlements in the Santarém Region of the Lower Amazon were not limited to the vicinities of permanent water courses, as previously assumed. Their fieldwork revealed numerous archaeological sites dating from around 1300 AD to the time of European colonization, associated with landscape features known as "Poços de Água" (water wells or depressions). The LiDAR data showed that this pattern of non-randomly distributed depressions extends far into the Tapajós National Forest, suggesting that inland settlement expanded considerably farther than previously established.

### Satellite and Aerial Imagery Provide Complementary Information
[Agapiou (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243418304410) explored the use of satellite multispectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data for the detection of buried archaeological remains. The research found that the combined use of these remote sensing techniques can provide complementary information, with aerial photography useful for detecting earthworks through shadow-marks, and multispectral satellite imagery helpful for identifying vegetation and soil signatures indicative of buried archaeological features.

### Machine Learning Improves Predictive Modeling of Archaeological Sites
[Walker and Hamilton (2018)](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-170.pdf) used machine learning techniques to predict the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites, including earthworks, anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs), and other non-earthwork/non-ADE sites. Their multi-class classification models, which incorporated spatial cross-validation to deal with spatial autocorrelation issues, demonstrated significant improvements in the generalizability of the models by including all three site types.

### Implications for Indigenous Land Rights
The [Science article](https://www.science.org/content/article/laser-mapping-reveals-hidden-structures-in-amazon-hints-thousands-more?cookieSet=1) highlights that the discovery of these extensive pre-Columbian earthworks in the Amazon may have implications for the land rights of today's Indigenous groups, as the earthworks serve as tangible proof of their ancestors' occupation and relationship with the forest.
