# Ceramic Typologies and Cultural Attribution in the Amazon

## Question
Which ceramic typologies are most commonly recovered from major Amazonian sites, and how do they aid cultural attribution?

## Summary
The analysis of ceramic artifacts recovered from archaeological sites in the Amazon region has provided valuable insights into the cultural practices and traditions of the pre-historic inhabitants. Several key ceramic typologies have been identified as commonly occurring in major Amazonian sites, and these typologies can aid in the cultural attribution of these sites.

## Commonly Recovered Ceramic Typologies

1. **Cariapé-tempered Ceramics**: The presence of cariapé (a type of plant-based temper) is considered a widespread and culturally significant trait in the production of ceramics in the prehistoric Amazon. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169131715000320)

2. **Cauixi-tempered Ceramics**: Cauixi, a type of sponge spicule, is another common non-plastic material used in Amazonian ceramic production. The use of cauixi has been documented across multiple archaeological sites in the region. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969806X18313549)

3. **Phosphate-rich Ceramics**: Ceramic fragments from Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) sites have been found to contain relatively high concentrations of phosphorus, likely due to exposure to phosphorus-rich foods or other materials used in the production process.

4. **Sand and Crushed Ceramic-tempered Ceramics**: Other common tempers used in Amazonian ceramics include sand, crushed ceramic, and various mineral inclusions such as feldspars.

## Cultural Attribution
The identification of these ceramic typologies and their distribution across Amazonian archaeological sites can provide valuable information for cultural attribution:

1. **Technological Traditions**: The consistent use of specific tempers, such as cariapé and cauixi, suggests the existence of distinct technological traditions and cultural practices associated with ceramic production in the region. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169131715000320)

2. **Subsistence and Diet**: The presence of phosphorus-rich ceramics in ADE sites can indicate the use of phosphorus-containing foods or materials in the ceramic production process, providing insights into the subsistence patterns and dietary preferences of the inhabitants. [scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/rem/a/tnmsdTCSgtb7bvHcxPrGCDS/?lang=en)

3. **Trade and Interaction**: The variation in ceramic tempers and mineral inclusions across sites can suggest the existence of regional exchange networks and cultural interactions among different groups inhabiting the Amazon.

By analyzing the ceramic typologies and their distribution, archaeologists can gain a better understanding of the cultural practices, subsistence strategies, and socioeconomic relationships that characterized the diverse pre-historic societies of the Amazon region.
