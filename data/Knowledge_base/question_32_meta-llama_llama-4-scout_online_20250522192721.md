# Expedition Records of Large Amazon Populations (1500-1800)
## Introduction
The Amazon region has been a subject of interest for explorers and researchers for centuries. This report aims to identify Spanish, Portuguese, and British expedition records from 1500-1800 that describe large Amazon populations.

## Spanish Expedition Records
The Spanish were among the first Europeans to explore the Amazon region. One of the earliest accounts of a large Amazon population comes from Francisco de Orellana, a Spanish explorer who traveled down the Amazon River in 1542. His account, as recorded by Antonio de Herrera [readingtheperiphery.org](https://readingtheperiphery.org/herrera/), describes a densely populated region with many large settlements.

Another significant Spanish expedition was led by Pedro Teixeira, who traveled up the Amazon River from Pará to Quito and back between 1637-1639. George Edmundson's account of Teixeira's voyage [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/2486841/files/article.pdf) provides valuable insights into the demographics and cultures of the Amazon region during this period.

## Portuguese Expedition Records
The Portuguese also conducted several expeditions to the Amazon region during the 16th to 18th centuries. One notable account is the "Relação" of Jacinto de Carvalho, a Portuguese Jesuit who worked in the Amazon missions from 1677 to 1744. His report, which is considered a primary ethnographic source for early 18th-century Amazonia, was translated from Italian to Portuguese and published in 2012 [scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/bgoeldi/a/sSX5W64997j8HjzxKW9B3LM/?lang=pt).

## British Expedition Records
While British expeditions to the Amazon region during this period were less frequent, there are still some notable records. Cristóbal de Acuña's "Relation de la riviere des Amazones" [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/relationdelarivi00acua/mode/1up) provides an account of the Amazon region and its inhabitants.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, several Spanish, Portuguese, and British expedition records from 1500-1800 describe large Amazon populations. These records provide valuable insights into the demographics, cultures, and ways of life of the people inhabiting the Amazon region during this period.
