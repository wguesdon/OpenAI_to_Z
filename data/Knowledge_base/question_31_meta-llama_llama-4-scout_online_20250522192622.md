# Colonial-Era Maps and Indigenous Settlements
The question of which colonial-era maps show settlements that don't appear in modern records is a complex one, with various cartographic and archaeological studies providing insights. This report will examine several academic sources to address this question.

## Introduction
Historical maps have been used to aid archaeological investigations into the persistence of Native American settlements during the mid-19th century. These maps can provide valuable information on indigenous patterns of residence, especially during the transition from missionary to settler colonialism.

## The Map of the Yurumanguí Indians
One example of a colonial-era map that shows settlements not appearing in modern records is the map of the Yurumanguí Indians. This map, created in the 18th century, provides evidence of the existence of indigenous settlements in the Pacific Lowlands that are not well-represented in modern records [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00822884.2020.1774964). The map was compiled by Caizedo, a Spanish colonial official, and appears to be a later, cleaner version of an earlier map.

## Finding Mid-19th Century Native Settlements
A study on historical maps in central California found that these maps can be used to discover and interpret archaeological deposits dating to the mid-19th century [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1416849). The researchers focused on Tomales Bay in central California and evaluated the usefulness of historical maps, such as diseños and plats, in identifying indigenous settlements.

## Encroachment by Word, Axis, and Tree
Another study on mapping techniques used during the colonization of New England found that English colonists used various techniques to encroach on unpurchased Native lands [cartographicperspectives.org](https://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/cp48-pearce). These techniques included removal of toponymy, alteration of boundary line locations, and use of a map grid. The study highlights the importance of considering the context in which maps were created and used.

## The Earliest Permanent Settlement in Carolina
A historical study on the earliest permanent settlement in Carolina examined the Comberford Map, which provides evidence of early European settlement in the region [jstor.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1905050?origin=crossref).

## Unveiling Southern Africa
John Barrow's map of 1801 is another example of a colonial-era map that provided new information on Southern Africa [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23729333.2021.1922808). The map allowed local mapmakers and commercial cartographers to fill in the southernmost part of Africa with detail based on personal observation and survey.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, various colonial-era maps show settlements that don't appear in modern records. These maps provide valuable insights into indigenous patterns of residence and the impact of colonialism on Native American communities. By examining these maps in their historical context, researchers can gain a better understanding of the complex relationships between European colonizers and indigenous peoples.
