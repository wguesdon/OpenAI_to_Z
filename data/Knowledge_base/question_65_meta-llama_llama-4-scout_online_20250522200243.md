# Optimal Combinations of Slope, Elevation, and Flood-Return Interval for Discriminating Occupied vs. Unused Terraces
## Introduction

This report aims to identify the optimal combinations of slope (Â°), elevation (m), and flood-return interval that best discriminate occupied vs. unused terraces. While the provided search results do not directly answer the question, they offer insights into the methods and factors used to study and analyze agricultural terraces.

## Methods and Factors Influencing Agricultural Terraces

Research has shown that environmental factors, such as slope, elevation, and terrain characteristics, play a crucial role in the distribution and management of agricultural terraces [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/5/962). For instance, a study in the Troodos foothills, Cyprus, used Maxent modeling to assess environmental constraints and terrace locations, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in modeling human-environment interactions [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622812001646).

## Analysis of Relevant Studies

1. **Machine Learning Approach**: A case study in Roya Valley, Southeast France, employed machine learning to detect agricultural terrace platforms using orthophotos and LiDAR-based digital terrain models. The results highlighted the value of machine learning for terrace mapping, with a user accuracy of 97% in Saorge and 72% in La Brigue [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/5/962).
2. **Geomorphometric Approach**: A study on estimating soil volumes stored in agricultural terrace systems used a geomorphometric approach, exploiting high-resolution topographic techniques to map and characterize geomorphological features [research.unipd.it](https://www.research.unipd.it/bitstream/11577/3390166/1/EGU21-1772-print.pdf).
3. **GIS-Based Detection**: A comparative test using regional DEMs and UAV data was conducted to detect terraced landscape heritage, highlighting the importance of integrating GIS tools with photo-interpretation and site surveys [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12518-018-0205-7.pdf).

## Conclusion

While the provided search results do not provide a direct answer to the question, they suggest that the optimal combinations of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval for discriminating occupied vs. unused terraces may vary depending on the specific study area and methodology employed. However, studies have shown that:

* Slope and elevation are significant factors influencing the distribution and management of agricultural terraces.
* Machine learning and geomorphometric approaches can be effective in detecting and analyzing agricultural terraces.
* GIS-based detection methods can be used to integrate with photo-interpretation and site surveys.

To determine the specific combinations of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval that best discriminate occupied vs. unused terraces, further research and analysis of site-specific data would be necessary.
