# Title
Indigenous Ancestral Sites: A Gap in Archaeological Documentation

## Restatement of the Question
Where have Indigenous communities reported ancestral sites that archaeologists haven't formally documented?

## Introduction
Indigenous communities have long been aware of the significance of ancestral sites, which hold deep cultural, spiritual, and historical importance. However, there are instances where these communities have reported sites that have not been formally documented by archaeologists. This report highlights some of these locations.

## Reported Sites
Several Indigenous communities have reported ancestral sites that require formal documentation by archaeologists. Some of these sites include:

### Unist'ot'en Territory, British Columbia
In 2019, the Unist'ot'en community reported significant archaeological findings, including stone tool artifacts estimated to be from the Shuswap Horizon (3500–2400 BP), at the Coastal GasLink (CGL) worksite [unistoten.camp](https://unistoten.camp/significant-archaeological-finding-pauses-cgl-work-on-unistoten-territory/). 

### Papaschase First Nation, Edmonton
The Papaschase First Nation in Edmonton believes it has located a burial site, which highlights the importance of collaboration between Indigenous communities and archaeologists to uncover and preserve ancestral sites [aptnnews.ca](https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/papaschase-first-nation-in-edmonton-believes-it-has-located-a-burial-site/).

### Sumas First Nation, Abbotsford
The Sumas First Nation in Abbotsford has identified over 40 burial mounds on their property, believed to date back to a smallpox epidemic in 1782. This site, known as Lightning Rock, holds significant spiritual importance to the community [cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/aboriginal-gravesites-halt-40m-development-plan-in-abbotsford-1.2852924).

## Challenges and Importance of Documentation
The documentation of ancestral sites is crucial for preserving Indigenous cultural heritage and ensuring that these sites are protected for future generations. However, there are challenges in documenting these sites, including:

* Limited resources and funding for archaeological research
* Lack of collaboration between Indigenous communities and archaeologists
* Inadequate documentation and preservation of sites

## Conclusion
The reporting of ancestral sites by Indigenous communities highlights the importance of collaboration between these communities and archaeologists. By working together, we can ensure that these sites are formally documented, preserved, and protected for future generations.
