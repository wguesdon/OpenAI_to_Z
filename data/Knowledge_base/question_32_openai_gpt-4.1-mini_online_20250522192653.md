# Report: Spanish, Portuguese, and British Expedition Records Describing Large Amazon Populations (1500-1800)

---

## Question Restatement

What Spanish, Portuguese, and British expedition records from 1500-1800 describe large Amazon populations?

---

## Introduction

Between 1500 and 1800, numerous expeditions from Spain, Portugal, and Britain probed the vast Amazon region. Their records serve as some of the earliest European accounts depicting indigenous populations in the Amazon basin. This report highlights key expedition documents from these colonial powers that specifically describe the presence and characteristics of large Amazonian populations.

## Spanish Expedition Records

### 1. Francisco de Orellana’s Voyage (1539–1541)

- **Context:** Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana was the first European to navigate the main stream of the Amazon River while separated from Gonzalo Pizarro’s expedition leaving Quito.
- **Details:** Orellana’s journey documented encountering numerous indigenous villages and populous communities along the Amazon. The accounts detail vast populations living in settlements, which impressed early observers with their size and organization.
- **Sources:** 
  - The account in **“The Voyage of Pedro Teixeira on the Amazon from Para to Quito and Back, 1637–39”** notes Orellana’s pioneering contact with these populations [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/2486841/files/article.pdf)
  - Antonio de Herrera’s *General History of the Western Indies* describes the voyage, commenting on large communities encountered downstream the San Juan de las Amazonas river, the early Spanish name for the Amazon [readingtheperiphery.org](https://readingtheperiphery.org/herrera/)

### 2. Jesuit Father Manuel Rodriguez’s Work

- A historical volume titled *El Marañon y Amazonas* by Jesuit Manuel Rodriguez compiles detailed histories of discoveries and missions, recording large groups of indigenous peoples in the Amazonian region and their social structures [books.google](https://books.google.com/books?id=QEpEWDaBH-UC).

### 3. Other Spanish Colonial Documents

- Various Spanish colonial letters, missionary reports, and ethnographic descriptions from the 17th and 18th centuries outline the presence of populous indigenous groups in the Amazon interior, emphasizing their cultures and settlements.

## Portuguese Expedition Records

### 1. Pedro Teixeira’s Amazon Expedition (1637-1639)

- Pedro Teixeira, a Portuguese explorer, undertook a significant river voyage from Pará to Quito and back, detailing indigenous communities along the Amazon and its tributaries.
- Reports describe large native groups inhabiting various "sertões" or backlands of the Amazon, focusing on their ways of life and interactions with colonists [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/2486841/files/article.pdf).

### 2. Jesuit Missionary Accounts

- Portuguese Jesuits, including Jacinto de Carvalho who published a descriptive report in 1719, provide detailed ethnographic observations of Amazonian peoples, noting their sizeable settlements and population structures [scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/bgoeldi/a/sSX5W64997j8HjzxKW9B3LM/?lang=pt).

### 3. Colonial Collecting Expeditions (c. 1750–1800)

- Portuguese expeditions associated with economic opportunities within the Amazonian "sertão" also documented indigenous populations, often describing the large numbers and the frontier nature of the region [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/colonial-collecting-expeditions-and-the-pursuit-of-opportunities-in-the-amazonian-sertao-c-17501800/664E3B6DBFEA1F3E3265A363B4BBF8A7).

## British Expedition Records

- British exploration of the Amazon during this period was less direct compared to Iberian powers but included naturalist and commercial expeditions in the 18th century.
- British accounts often referenced Spanish and Portuguese reports when describing populations but also included newfound ethnographic observations of large indigenous communities, especially via trade and exploratory encounters.
- Specific named British expeditions that described large Amazon populations in detail are scarce between 1500-1800; however, records from later naturalists and traders started compiling information on populous native groups.

---

## Summary

- **Spanish records** prominently include early and detailed accounts from Francisco de Orellana’s expedition and Jesuit missionaries such as Manuel Rodriguez.
- **Portuguese records** highlight Pedro Teixeira’s voyage, Jesuit missionary ethnographies (e.g., Jacinto de Carvalho), and colonial collecting expeditions documenting large populations in Amazonian backlands.
- **British records** in this early period are less indigenous-population focused but later 18th-century exploratory trade documents acknowledge populous Amazonian groups drawing on Iberian sources.
