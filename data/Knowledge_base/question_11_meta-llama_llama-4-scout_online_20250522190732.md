# Open Archaeological Databases in the Amazon
The question of whether there are open archaeological databases containing verified site locations in the Amazon is addressed below.

## Introduction
The Amazon region, spanning across nine countries in South America, is rich in archaeological sites that hold significant information about the pre-Columbian era. However, accessing detailed information about these sites can be challenging due to their often remote locations and the sensitive nature of archaeological data.

## Existing Databases
Several databases and projects have been initiated to catalog and make accessible information about archaeological sites in the Americas, including the Amazon region. Some of these include:

### Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA)
[opencontext.org](https://opencontext.org/projects/d75ef68a-0e23-458c-976d-286d83c13013) is a comprehensive database that, while not exclusively focused on the Amazon, provides valuable information on Paleoindian sites across the Americas. It is hoped that as more people contribute data, these problems will diminish over time. The information posted on this web site replaces and represents a marked expansion of the earlier North American Paleoindian Projectile Point Database.

### The Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Archaeological Record in Brazil
[academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/11548691/The_Late_Pleistocene_Early_Holocene_archaeological_record_in_Brazil_A_geo_referenced_database) and [semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Late-Pleistocene%2FEarly-Holocene-archaeological-Bueno-Dias/64bf3cd2268d3d37a7d01c6f3a5ad075501a2150) provide access to research and databases focusing on the late Pleistocene and early Holocene archaeological record in Brazil, which is part of the Amazon region. A compilation of 63 stratigraphic situations with evidence for human presence and two or more radiocarbon ages older than 10,500 B.P. has been processed to increase the accuracy and precision of the data.

### Contribución para un primer inventario general de sitios arqueológicos del Perú
[repositorio.cultura.gob.pe](https://repositorio.cultura.gob.pe/handle/CULTURA/85) offers a contribution to a first general inventory of archaeological sites in Peru, which, while not exclusively Amazonian, includes sites within the Amazon region of Peru.

### SIGDA
[sigda.cultura.gob.pe](https://sigda.cultura.gob.pe/) is a platform that provides information on archaeological sites in Peru, including those in the Amazon region. However, the information is in Spanish and may require further consultation for detailed site locations.

## Conclusion
While there are databases and resources available that contain information on archaeological sites in the Amazon region, the specificity and accessibility of verified site locations can vary. Researchers and interested parties are encouraged to explore the mentioned databases and contact the respective authorities or contributors for more detailed information.
