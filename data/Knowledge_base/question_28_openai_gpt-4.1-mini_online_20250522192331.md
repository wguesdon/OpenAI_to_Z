## Primary Accounts Mentioning Large Settlements

### 1. **Account by Gaspar de Carvajal**

One of the principal primary accounts comes from **Friar Gaspar de Carvajal**, the Dominican missionary who accompanied the expedition. Carvajal wrote a detailed chronicle describing the journey and includes vivid descriptions of encountering significant native populations and large settlements along the Amazon.

- Carvajal’s descriptions depict numerous densely populated villages with large multi-family dwellings, sustained agriculture, and advanced social structures — challenging previously held European assumptions about Amazonia being a sparsely inhabited wilderness.
- His account is considered one of the earliest European records of complex Amazonian societies and is foundational in understanding indigenous life in the region at the time.

### 2. **Antonio de Herrera’s “General History of the Western Indies”**

Another historical narrative, **Antonio de Herrera’s** chronicle, written decades later but based on official documents and testimonies, recounts the expedition and also refers to the discovery of large settlements encountered on the river.

- Herrera describes the expedition setting out on what was called the "San Juan de las Amazonas," and the crew encountering numerous inhabited locations along the river.
- He notes that after setting off from Gonzalo Pizarro’s forces, Orellana’s group was both surprised and challenged by the extensive indigenous presence, mentioning the difficulty of navigating through populated regions and the necessity of repairing boats and provisions.

### 3. **Clements R. Markham’s Translation and Introduction**

The 19th-century editor and translator **Clements R. Markham** published versions and analyses of the expedition’s primary documents, including Carvajal’s narrative. He emphasized the importance of these accounts in reporting the existence of large, organized native communities.

- Markham underscored that aside from river navigation and logistical challenges, the expedition encountered dense human settlements.
- His introduction and commentary provide context that these settlements were substantially sized, contradicting myths of an unpopulated Amazon.

## Summary

- The **most detailed primary firsthand account** of large settlements encountered during Orellana’s expedition comes from **Friar Gaspar de Carvajal**, whose writings specify the size and complexity of these Amazonian groups.
- **Antonio de Herrera’s historical work**, drawing on official Spanish records and other testimonies, corroborates the presence of sizable indigenous settlements.
- Later editors like **Clements R. Markham** helped preserve and highlight these accounts, further confirming how the expedition’s reports contributed to historical and anthropological understandings of Amazonia.
