# Uncovering Ancient Indigenous Cities Through Oral Histories

## Question
What Indigenous oral histories describe ancient cities or large settlements?

## Summary of Findings

The web search results provide insights into how Indigenous oral histories have helped uncover and understand ancient cities and large settlements in North America. Some key findings include:

1. **Cahokia**: Oral histories and observations by Europeans suggest that the ancient city of Cahokia was founded by leaders or a charismatic leader who promised a spiritual and cultural rebirth. The city was likely spawned by a social movement that swept across the US South and Midwest along the Mississippi River.

2. **Indigenous Knowledge and Archaeology**: Indigenous oral traditions have been dismissed by some anthropologists in the past as "historically worthless." However, more recent research has shown that these traditions can provide valuable insights and guide archaeological investigations. For example, Indigenous knowledge has helped unravel the mystery of the abandonment of Mesa Verde in the American Southwest.

3. **Chaco and Cahokia**: Both the ancient cities of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico and Cahokia in Illinois demonstrate the impressive urban planning and agricultural expertise of Indigenous peoples in North America. Knowledge of astronomy played a major role in the cultures of both these ancient settlements. [theindy.org](https://www.theindy.org/article/809)

4. **North Carolina**: While there are no written records, archaeological evidence and rare early historical accounts suggest that prehistoric Native Americans in North Carolina relied on oral traditions to keep records of their origins, myths, and histories.
