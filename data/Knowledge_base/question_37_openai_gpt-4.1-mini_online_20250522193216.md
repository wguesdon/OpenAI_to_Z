# Indigenous Oral Histories Depicting Ancient Cities and Large Settlements

**Question:**  
*What Indigenous oral histories describe ancient cities or large settlements?*

---

## Introduction

Indigenous oral histories are rich repositories of knowledge, culture, and historical memory that describe not only the origins and myths of certain peoples but also accounts of ancient cities and large settlements. These histories are often complemented and confirmed by archaeological findings, despite earlier skepticism from some Western scholars.

This report outlines notable Indigenous oral histories that describe ancient urban centers or large settlements in North America, correlating these narratives with archaeological and historical research.

## Key Indigenous Oral Histories and Corresponding Archaeological Sites

### 1. Cahokia: The Great Native American City

One of the most well-documented large ancient settlements in Indigenous oral traditions and archaeological studies is **Cahokia**, located near present-day St. Louis, Missouri.

- **Oral Accounts and Origins:**  
  While the Cahokians left no written records, Indigenous oral histories and European observations from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that Cahokia was founded by spiritual leaders or a charismatic figure promising cultural and spiritual renewal. This settlement emerged from a widespread social movement along the Mississippi River that significantly shaped the urban landscape. Cahokia is renowned for its massive earthworks and monumental mounds, with the site often conceptualized as more than just a religious center but a vibrant and complex city built on social and spiritual dynamics.

- **Archaeological Evidence:**  
  Cahokia was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, thriving around 1050â€“1350 CE. It featured complex urban planning, large public works, and extensive trade networks.

### 2. Chaco Canyon: Pueblo Bonito and Ancestral Puebloan Urbanism

In the Southwestern U.S., Indigenous oral traditions describe the grandeur and complexity of settlements like those at **Chaco Canyon** in New Mexico.

- **Oral Traditions:**  
  Communities recount stories around the construction of Pueblo Bonito, an immense multi-story structure with approximately 800 rooms, which was the largest building in North America until the 19th century. These oral histories reflect the social organization, cosmology, and agricultural knowledge that supported such urbanism. The importance of astronomy, tied to agricultural cycles, is a recurring theme in these narratives.

- **Legacy:**  
  The oral histories help explain the cultural significance and purpose of these large settlements, underlining their roles as centers of social, ceremonial, and economic life.

### 3. Other Oral Histories Highlighting Ancient Settlements

- **Mesa Verde & Surrounding Regions:**  
  Indigenous oral histories accompany archaeological evidence of sudden abandonment and conflict in settlements like Mesa Verde. Stories sometimes recount tragedies such as massacres or migration, reflecting migrations, violence, and cultural changes.

- **General Indigenous Traditions Without Written Language:**  
  Indigenous groups across North America often used oral storytelling to preserve knowledge about origins, social movements, and large inhabited places. These traditions have helped archaeologists reconstruct histories dating back thousands of years, including the understanding of migration routes and settlement patterns during and after the Ice Age.

## The Role and Validity of Indigenous Oral Histories

Historically, Indigenous oral traditions were dismissed by some early anthropologists as inaccurate or "primitive" [example: Robert Lowie in 1917]. However, recent shifts recognize that these narratives are invaluable for understanding history. They often encode complex information about climate, migration, social change, and urban development that aligns with archaeological and environmental data.

- These oral histories guide archaeologists to sites and contextualize findings, fostering a deeper understanding of ancient urbanism beyond mere material remains.

## Summary

- Indigenous oral histories recount the development of major ancient settlements such as Cahokia in the Midwest and Chaco Canyon in the Southwest.
- These narratives explain the social, religious, and agricultural foundations that enabled the growth of complex urban centers.
- Indigenous oral traditions have been increasingly recognized as vital complements to archaeology, enriching historical understanding and correcting earlier misconceptions.
- Stories also describe periods of conflict, migration, and abandonment, offering insights into the transformations of these ancient communities.
