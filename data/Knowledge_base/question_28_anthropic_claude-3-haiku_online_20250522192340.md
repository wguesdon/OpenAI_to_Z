## Francisco de Orellana's 1541-1542 Expedition and Mentions of Large Settlements

The question asks about primary accounts from Francisco de Orellana's 1541-1542 expedition that mention large settlements.

[readingtheperiphery.org](https://readingtheperiphery.org/herrera/) provides an account from Antonio de Herrera's "General History of the Western Indies - Book IX", which states:

> "Voyaging, as they say, with the design of returning to Gonzalo Pizarro, with provisions, they found themselves, after going over two hundred leagues, unable to return, and, therefore, continued to sail on until they came out into the ocean."

This suggests that Orellana and his crew continued their voyage down the Amazon river, going over 200 leagues (around 600 miles) before reaching the ocean, without being able to return to Gonzalo Pizarro.

> "Passing the mouths of many rivers on the south side, they continued their course for three days, without seeing any habitation."

This suggests that for three days, Orellana and his crew did not see any large settlements or habitations along the Amazon river.

The other sources provided do not directly mention large settlements encountered by Orellana's expedition. Overall, the primary accounts seem to focus more on the journey and challenges faced, rather than providing detailed descriptions of large settlements along the way.
