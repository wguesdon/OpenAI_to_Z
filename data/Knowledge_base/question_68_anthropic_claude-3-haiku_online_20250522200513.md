# Least-Cost Path Analysis and Regional Road/Causeway Networks

## Question

How does least-cost path analysis between paired earthwork complexes suggest regional road or causeway networks?

## Introduction

Least-cost path analysis (LCPA) is a geospatial technique used to model and understand the potential routes and connectivity between archaeological sites or other locations of interest. By analyzing the optimal, least-cost paths between paired sites, researchers can gain insights into the potential infrastructure and transportation networks that may have existed in the past.

## Least-Cost Path Analysis Methodology

The key steps in applying LCPA to investigate regional road or causeway networks include:

1. **Identifying Paired Sites**: Researchers first select pairs of archaeological sites, such as earthwork complexes, that are of interest for understanding potential connectivity and transportation networks.

2. **Constructing Terrain Model**: A detailed digital elevation model (DEM) or terrain data is used to represent the physical landscape between the paired sites.

3. **Determining Cost Factors**: Factors that influence the "cost" of traversing the landscape, such as slope, terrain ruggedness, and other geographic features, are identified and quantified. These cost factors are used to create a cost surface or friction layer.

4. **Calculating Least-Cost Paths**: Using the cost surface, LCPA algorithms are applied to determine the optimal, least-cost path between the paired sites. This results in modeled routes that minimize the overall "cost" of travel.

5. **Comparing Modeled Paths to Archaeological Evidence**: The modeled least-cost paths are then compared to the actual archaeological remains of roads, causeways, or other transportation infrastructure to assess the potential connectivity and regional networks.

## Case Studies

Several studies have used LCPA to investigate potential road or causeway networks between paired earthwork complexes:

[journal.caa-international.org](https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.36):
This study applied LCPA to model timber importation routes to Chaco Canyon, finding a strong correlation between modeled paths and the actual road locations, suggesting the roads were designed to facilitate resource transportation.

This research used LCPA to test whether the Göksu valley in Turkey could have served as a communication route, finding that the modeled least-cost paths aligned with archaeological evidence of past interaction and transportation.

This study applied LCPA to explore changing trade routes between the Gulf Coast and Soconusco regions of Mexico, highlighting how the method can be used to infer the logic of ancient trade networks.

## Conclusion

Least-cost path analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the potential connectivity and transportation networks that may have existed between paired archaeological sites, such as earthwork complexes. By modeling the optimal, least-cost paths and comparing them to the archaeological evidence, researchers can gain insights into the regional infrastructure and the factors that influenced the development of these networks.
