# Machine-Learning Feature-Importance Rankings for Predicting Site Presence
## Introduction

The question at hand involves understanding the importance of various environmental and geographical features in predicting the presence of archaeological sites, specifically using machine learning techniques. The features mentioned include water distance, Terra Preta (Amazonian Dark Earth) proximity, and canopy-height variance, among others.

## Restating the Question

What machine-learning feature-importance rankings emerge when predicting site presence using variables such as water distance, Terra Preta proximity, and canopy-height variance?

## Approach

To address this question, we need to look into studies that have employed machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of archaeological sites based on environmental and geographical variables. The importance of features such as water distance, Terra Preta proximity, and canopy-height variance can vary depending on the specific model, dataset, and geographical area being studied.

## Findings from Relevant Studies

Several studies have explored the use of machine learning for predicting archaeological site presence:

### Predicting Geographic Distribution of Ancient Amazonian Archaeological Sites

A study published in [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020851) used machine learning algorithms to classify earthworks versus Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) sites versus other non-earthwork/non-ADE archaeological sites. They used soils, climate, and distances to rivers of different types and sizes as geospatial predictors. The models were tested with spatial cross-validation, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91 at the optimal spatial scale of 1 km.

### Soil Carbon Stock in Archaeological Black Earth

Another study found in [acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/agj2.20345) focused on predicting soil carbon stock in Archaeological Black Earth (ABE) under different land use scenarios. While not directly addressing feature importance for site presence prediction, it highlights the significance of ABE in environmental studies.

### A New Methodological Framework for Geophysical Sensor Combinations

Research discussed in [gmd.copernicus.org](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/1219/2022/gmd-15-1219-2022-supplement.pdf) introduced a framework for combining geophysical sensors with machine learning to understand soil attributes. This approach could be relevant for assessing the importance of various environmental features.

### Ranking Importance of Topographical Surface and Subsurface Parameters

A study in [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/2/577/pdf) ranked the importance of topographical surface and subsurface parameters on paludification in northern boreal forests. It used very high-resolution remotely sensed datasets.

### Sample Design Effects on Soil Unit Prediction

Finally, [rbcsjournal.org](https://www.rbcsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/articles_xml/1806-9657-rbcs-44-e0190120/1806-9657-rbcs-44-e0190120.pdf) examined the effects of sample design on soil unit prediction with machine learning, discussing randomness, uncertainty, and majority maps.

## Feature-Importance Rankings

While specific feature-importance rankings from these studies are not directly provided in the search results, we can infer that:

- Distance to water bodies (rivers, etc.) is likely a significant predictor, given the historical importance of water sources for human settlements.
- Proximity to Terra Preta (Amazonian Dark Earth) sites could be crucial, as these areas are known for their fertile soil and historical human habitation.
- Canopy-height variance might also play a role, as it could indicate areas with less disturbance or unique ecological conditions.

## Conclusion

The exact machine-learning feature-importance rankings for predicting site presence using variables like water distance, Terra Preta proximity, and canopy-height variance would depend on the specifics of each study, including the geographical context, the machine learning model used, and the dataset. However, these factors are likely to be among the most important in predicting archaeological site presence.
