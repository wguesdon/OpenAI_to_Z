# Exploring Publicly Available Multispectral Satellite Data

## Question
What public multispectral satellite data exists for the target region?

## Overview of Relevant Satellite Data

Based on the web search results, the following multispectral satellite data appear to be relevant for the target region:

1. **Sentinel-2**:
   - [sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-2](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-2)
   - The Sentinel-2 mission is part of the European Union's Copernicus program, consisting of two identical satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) that provide high-resolution optical imagery of land and coastal areas.
   - The satellites have a spatial resolution of 10-60 meters and a revisit time of 5 days.
   - The data is freely available and can be accessed through the Copernicus Open Access Hub or other data portals.

2. **Landsat**:
   - [www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/data](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/data)
   - The Landsat program is a joint initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, providing a continuous record of moderate-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface since the 1970s.
   - The latest Landsat satellites (Landsat 8 and Landsat 9) offer multispectral data with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a revisit time of 16 days.
   - Landsat data is freely available through the USGS EarthExplorer and other portals.

3. **Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion**:
   - [www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-earth-observing-one-eo-1-hyperion](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-earth-observing-one-eo-1-hyperion)
   - EO-1 Hyperion was a hyperspectral sensor that operated from 2000 to 2017, providing high-spectral-resolution data with 220 spectral bands.
   - The data has a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a standard scene length of 42 kilometers, with an optional increased scene length of 185 kilometers.
   - EO-1 Hyperion data is available through the USGS EROS archive, but the processing and availability of scenes may be limited.

These satellite data sources offer a range of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions that can be useful for various applications in the target region, such as land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, and environmental assessment.
