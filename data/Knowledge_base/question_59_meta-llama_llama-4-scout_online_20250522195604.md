# Archaeological Site Locations in the Amazon Forest
## Introduction

The Amazon forest is home to a vast array of archaeological sites, many of which remain undiscovered. Researchers have been working to identify locations that are likely to be linked to these sites, based on factors such as water proximity and proximity to known settlements.

## Factors Influencing Archaeological Site Locations

Studies have shown that archaeological sites in the Amazon forest are often located near:

* Water sources, such as rivers and streams
* Areas with fertile soil and abundant resources
* Regions with unique geological features, such as cavities or depressions

## Locations Likely to be Linked to Archaeological Sites

Based on recent research, the following locations in the Amazon forest are likely to be linked to archaeological sites:

### 1. The Santarém Region, Lower Amazon

The Santarém Region, located in the Lower Amazon, has been identified as a hub for pre-Columbian settlements [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1417198). Archaeological sites in this region have been found to be associated with particular features in the landscape, including:

* Cavities or depressions, known locally as “Poços de Água”
* Upland areas, such as the Belterra Plateau

### 2. The Southern Rim of the Amazon

The southern rim of the Amazon, also known as the Southern Amazonian Rim (SRA), has been identified as a region with a high concentration of pre-Columbian earthworks [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7). This region is characterized by:

* A chain of Arawak-speaking populations
* A belt of Arawak and other groups that constitutes a formative supra-regional system

### 3. The Peruvian Amazon

The Peruvian Amazon has been found to be home to hundreds of archaeological sites, many of which remain unpublished [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7.pdf). These sites are likely to be located in areas with:

* Fertile soil and abundant resources
* Unique geological features, such as rivers and streams

### 4. Areas with High Concentrations of Earthworks

Areas with high concentrations of earthworks, such as those found in the Amazonian region of Brazil, are likely to be linked to archaeological sites [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/). These earthworks are often associated with:

* Pre-Columbian settlements
* Complex societies with a high degree of social organization

## Conclusion

The locations mentioned above are likely to be linked to archaeological sites in the Amazon forest. However, further research is needed to confirm the presence of these sites and to uncover new ones. By using machine learning models and spatial cross-validation folds, researchers can better predict the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites and identify areas that are likely to be linked to these sites.
