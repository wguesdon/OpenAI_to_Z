# Dating Techniques for Amazon Archaeological Sites

## Question
What dating techniques have been used to establish chronologies for known Amazon sites?

## Introduction
The Amazon rainforest in South America is home to a rich archaeological record that has provided valuable insights into the region's past human settlements and cultural developments. Establishing accurate chronologies for these archaeological sites is crucial for understanding the timing and sequence of cultural changes. Researchers have employed various dating techniques to determine the age of artifacts and sediments from Amazon sites.

## Dating Techniques Used
The web search results reveal several dating techniques that have been utilized to establish chronologies for archaeological sites in the Amazon region:

1. **Radiocarbon Dating**:
   - [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.254.5038.1621?cookieSet=1) mentions the use of calibrated accelerator radiocarbon dating on charcoal, shell, and pottery from a prehistoric shell midden near Santarém, Brazil.
   - [scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/aabc/a/wdmLRpBssW3PYMZX58Kv38f/?lang=en) notes that radiocarbon dating has been used to understand the dynamics of Amazonian fluvial systems, but its applicability is limited due to the lack of organic material, especially in older alluvial deposits.

2. **Luminescence Dating**:
   - [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078) reports the use of thermoluminescence (TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques to date pottery fragments from the Hatahara archaeological site in the Amazon Valley.
   - [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969806X12005397) and [scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/aabc/a/wdmLRpBssW3PYMZX58Kv38f/?lang=en) describe the application of OSL dating to sediments from the Negro and Solimões rivers in the Amazon region, contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of these waterways.

3. **Other Techniques**:
   - [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aav5449) mentions the use of human burials and their contents to establish the earliest settlements in the Llanos de Moxos region of southwestern Amazonia, dating back to between 10,600 and 4,000 years ago.

## Conclusion
The web search results indicate that researchers have employed a variety of dating techniques, including radiocarbon dating, luminescence dating (TL, OSL, and EPR), and the analysis of human burials, to establish chronologies for archaeological sites in the Amazon region. These techniques have provided valuable insights into the timing and sequence of human settlements and cultural developments in this complex and diverse tropical environment.
