# Oral Traditions and Their Commemoration of Landscape Modifications

## Question Restated
**In which oral traditions are specific landscape modifications—such as raised fields, causeways, or fish-weirs—explicitly described or ritually commemorated?**

---

## Introduction

Landscape modifications like raised fields, causeways, and fish-weirs represent significant human ecological engineering and social-cultural practices. Various Indigenous and traditional oral traditions explicitly describe, ritualize, and commemorate these landscape features, embedding them within the communities' histories, cosmologies, and moral economies. This report draws on recent ethnographic, archaeological, and ethnohistorical research to identify the oral traditions in which such features are integrally narrated or ritualized.

## Fish-Weir Narratives: Indigenous Pacific Northwest Traditions

One vivid example comes from the Indigenous communities of the Pacific Northwest of North America. Fish-weirs—trap-like constructions in rivers to catch salmon and other fish—are central features in their subsistence and cultural landscapes.

- Oral traditions in these communities explicitly describe fish-weirs and the tensions around their use, reflecting social struggles, reciprocity, and power dynamics among groups competing for fishing rights.
- Stories about "Coyote broke the dams" illustrate how fish-weirs are not only physical structures but also subjects of mythic and moral narratives passed down through generations.
- These narratives serve as social charters regulating the use of the weirs and convey coded knowledge about environmental stewardship and community relations.

## Raised Fields and Monumentality in Maya Lowlands Traditions

In the northern Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica, monumental constructions and landscape modifications—such as raised fields for agriculture and stone causeways—are deeply embedded in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and ritual practices.

- Oral traditions here are less explicitly documented in mythic form but are connected to the collective understanding of the landscape’s fertility and management.
- Raising fields and gathering stones for monument construction were ritualized agricultural practices, indicating an intimate relationship between political complexity, subsistence activities, and ceremonial life.
- These modifications and monuments are viewed not only as physical adaptations but as manifestations of living knowledge and ancestral engagement with the environment.

Chelsea Fisher (2023) proposes that Maya monumentality is a form of ritualized traditional ecological knowledge, linking landscape alterations to social memory and ritual embodiment [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/monumentality-as-traditional-ecological-knowledge-in-the-northern-maya-lowlands/AA6A8929668238225DA4F1A247AB2FF7).

## Causeways and Ritual Pathways in Torres Strait Islander Oral Traditions

In far north Australia, among the Eastern Torres Strait Islander peoples, causeways and ritual pathways are intricately connected to public memory and ritual performance.

- Oral histories commemorate the construction and use of causeways associated with the Waiet cult, a series of island-wide ritual practices.
- These causeways serve as physical and symbolic links across islands, marking ceremonial spaces that persist in collective memory.
- Ritual pathways are performed and remembered through dance and narrative, demonstrating a living archaeological and historical tradition.

Wright and Van Der Kolk (2018) highlight the role of oral tradition and ethno-archaeology in understanding how these pathways and their associated ceremonies are embedded in public memory [journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1469605318771186).

## Other Relevant Oral Traditions

### Owl-Shaped Village and Earthworks at Poverty Point

- The Muskogee-identified community in the US South connects large earthworks with Indigenous narratives of an owl-shaped village.
- Stories describe human movement and embodiment associated with the owl form reflected in the landscape.
- These narratives ritualize and embody the landscape, emphasizing multispecies relationships and sensory participation.

**Reference:**  
Bloch (2019) explores how these oral traditions embody community identity through landscape form and ritual movement [journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1469605319846985).

### Shell Mounds in Southern California

- Shell mounds, some dating back thousands of years, are sites of repeated feasting, mortuary rites, and ceremony.
- Oral traditions, alongside archaeological evidence, suggest these mounds commemorate social memory and community identity, linking human groups to specific places.
- The ritual commemoration includes social reinforcements and mythic histories encoded in the mound.

## Conclusion

Oral traditions across diverse Indigenous and traditional communities around the world explicitly describe and ritualize landscape modifications such as fish-weirs, raised fields, causeways, and mounds. These narratives and rituals encode complex social, ecological, and moral knowledge, linking human communities with their environments over time. They play critical roles in sustaining social memory, regulating resource use, and embodying traditional ecological knowledge.
