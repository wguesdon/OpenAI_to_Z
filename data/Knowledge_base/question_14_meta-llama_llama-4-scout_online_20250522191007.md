# Public Platforms for Indigenous Territorial Boundaries and Ethno-Linguistic Data Layers
The question of which public platforms curate Indigenous territorial boundaries and ethno-linguistic data layers is an important one, as it relates to the preservation and dissemination of vital information about Indigenous cultures and territories.

## Introduction
There are several public platforms that provide access to Indigenous territorial boundaries and ethno-linguistic data layers. These platforms are crucial for researchers, policymakers, and Indigenous communities who seek to understand and work with this information.

## Platforms

### 1. Native Land
[Native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) is a platform that provides a map of Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties. The map is a living document, informed by the contributions of Indigenous communities, Indigenous knowledge holders, and their stories. It does not claim to represent official or legal boundaries [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/).

### 2. First Peoples' Map of B.C.
[Maps.fpcc.ca](https://maps.fpcc.ca/) is a platform that provides a map of Indigenous languages, arts, and heritage in British Columbia, Canada. The platform includes data layers on language, territories, and treaties [maps.fpcc.ca](https://maps.fpcc.ca/).

### 3. Aboriginal and Treaty Rights Information System (ATRIS)
[Sidait-atris.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca](https://sidait-atris.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/atris_online/home-accueil.aspx) is a platform provided by the Government of Canada that provides information on Aboriginal and treaty rights [sidait-atris.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca](https://sidait-atris.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/atris_online/home-accueil.aspx).

### 4. Native Maps
[NativeMaps.org](http://nativemaps.org/?p=3932) is a platform that provides a shape tool for creating and sharing maps of Indigenous territories and languages. The platform incorporates background layers, including satellite imagery, and allows users to turn on various layers from the Government of BC [nativemaps.org](http://nativemaps.org/?p=3932).

## Conclusion
These public platforms are essential resources for anyone seeking to understand Indigenous territorial boundaries and ethno-linguistic data layers. They provide valuable information and tools for researchers, policymakers, and Indigenous communities.
