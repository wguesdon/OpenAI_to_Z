# Distance-Decay Threshold for Undiscovered Terra Preta Features
## Introduction

Terra Preta, also known as Amazonian Dark Earth, is a type of anthropogenic soil found in the Amazon region. It is characterized by its dark color, high fertility, and ability to store carbon. The distribution of Terra Preta is not uniform, and its presence is often associated with ancient human settlements.

## Restating the Question

What distance-decay threshold from documented Terra Preta patches correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features?

## Analysis of Existing Research

Several studies have investigated the distribution and characteristics of Terra Preta in the Amazon region. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3896013/?report=reader) used modeling efforts to predict the distribution of Terra Preta and found that it is likely to be found throughout approximately 154,063 kmÂ² or 3.2% of the forest. [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2010.512941) used a logistic model to create a predictive map of Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) location.

## Distance-Decay Threshold

While the exact distance-decay threshold from documented Terra Preta patches that correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features is not explicitly stated in the search results, [esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2035) used maximum entropy modeling to develop a predictive model of Amazonian Dark Earth sites across the Amazon Basin. The study found that Amazonian Dark Earth sites were predicted to be primarily along the main rivers and in eastern Amazonia.

## Conclusion

Based on the available research, it appears that the distance-decay threshold for undiscovered Terra Preta features is not well-defined. However, the studies suggest that Terra Preta is often found in areas with high concentrations of ancient human settlements, such as along rivers and in eastern Amazonia. Further research is needed to determine the exact distance-decay threshold that correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features.
