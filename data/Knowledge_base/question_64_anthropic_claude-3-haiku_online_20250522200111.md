- The article discusses using kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyze the intensity of Neolithic and Eneolithic settlements in the Romanian Moldavia region. KDE is used to create density maps for different time periods, which are then compared to analyze the dynamic changes in settlement patterns over time.

- This article explores some archaeological applications of kernel density estimates, noting that the methodology can be used for informal spatial cluster analysis. However, the lack of accessible software may be a reason for the limited use of KDE by archaeologists.

- The paper presents an investigation of the influence of alluvial geomorphology on settlement strategies in the Po Plain (Northern Italy) during the Roman and Medieval periods, using point pattern analysis. It aims to assess the impact of changes in water management on the spatial distribution of archaeological sites.

- The chapter explores the geoarchaeological evidence for Archaic and Woodland occupation along the lower Nottawasaga River floodplain in southern Ontario, Canada. It discusses the use of various methods, including soil-sediment analysis, sedimentological profiling, and ground-penetrating radar, to understand the environmental changes and their impact on the archaeological record.

## Discussion

The web search results suggest that kernel density estimation (KDE) and related spatial analysis techniques can be useful tools for revealing patterns and dynamics in archaeological settlement data, particularly in relation to environmental factors such as paleo-channels and fluvial geomorphology.

The first article demonstrates how KDE can be used to map the intensity of settlements over time, allowing researchers to analyze changes in settlement patterns and potentially identify corridors or areas of concentrated occupation. This approach could be applied to study the relationship between known archaeological sites and paleo-channels that may be obscured by modern landscapes, such as forested areas.

The other articles highlight the value of integrating geomorphological and geoarchaeological methods to understand the physical settings and environmental context of archaeological sites. Techniques like paleochannel analysis, soil-sediment analysis, and ground-penetrating radar can provide insights into landscape changes that may have influenced human settlement and occupation patterns.

By combining these spatial analysis and geoarchaeological approaches, it may be possible to reveal settlement corridors or hotspots along paleo-channels that are no longer visible on the modern surface. The key would be to have a robust archaeological dataset of known sites, which could then be analyzed using KDE or other spatial statistics to identify patterns and potential relationships with paleogeographic features.

## Conclusion

The web search results suggest that kernel density estimation and related spatial analysis techniques, when combined with geoarchaeological methods, have the potential to reveal settlement corridors along paleo-channels that are now hidden beneath forest or other modern landscapes. Integrating these approaches can provide valuable insights into the environmental and landscape factors that influenced past human settlement and occupation patterns.
