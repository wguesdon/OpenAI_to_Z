# Detecting Amazonian Archaeological Sites using Amazonian Dark Earths

## Question
What are Amazonian Dark Earths, and can they be used to detect Amazonian archaeological sites from satellite images?

## Introduction
Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are a type of anthropogenic soil found in the Amazon Basin that are enriched with organic matter, charcoal, and other artifacts, indicating long-term human habitation and land use. These distinct dark-colored soils stand in contrast to the typically nutrient-poor and yellowish soils of the Amazon rainforest. Researchers have explored the potential of using ADEs as a means to detect and locate ancient archaeological sites across the Amazon region using satellite imagery and other remote sensing technologies.

## Amazonian Dark Earths
Amazonian Dark Earths are qualitatively distinct from the surrounding soils in the Amazon Basin. They are characterized by:
- Deep, dark-colored anthropogenic soils, often several meters thick
- High levels of organic matter, charcoal, and archaeological artifacts
- Elevated concentrations of nutrients like phosphorus and calcium, which are typically scarce in Amazonian soils

[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20184-2.pdf) suggests that the genesis of ADEs was not solely due to human activity, but rather a result of the interplay between natural processes of landscape formation and indigenous land management practices. Nevertheless, the distinctive properties of ADEs are strongly linked to long-term human habitation and land use in the Amazon.

## Detecting Archaeological Sites with ADEs
Researchers have explored the potential of using ADEs as a means to detect and locate ancient archaeological sites across the Amazon region using satellite imagery and other remote sensing technologies:

[pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020851) describes a study that used machine learning algorithms to classify and predict the geographic distribution of different types of archaeological sites in the Amazon, including earthworks and ADEs, based on factors like soil characteristics, climate, and proximity to rivers. The model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91, demonstrating the potential of this approach to assist in the discovery and preservation of Amazonian archaeological sites.

[www.wired.com](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/satellite-sensing-black-earth-amazon/?cid=4800984) discusses how the distinct black color of ADEs, which is otherwise invisible from above, can be detected using satellite remote sensing. The article highlights how the nutrient-rich ADEs mark the locations of pre-Columbian archaeological sites, allowing researchers to potentially identify these sites across the Amazon.

[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320301618) presents a study that explored the relationship between soils, vegetation indices, and landscape domestication in the Floresta Nacional de Caxiuan√£ in the Brazilian Amazon, demonstrating the potential to use these methods to trace and calibrate long-term forest management by pre-Columbian Amazonians.

## Conclusion
Amazonian Dark Earths, with their distinctive soil properties and strong link to long-term human habitation, offer a promising avenue for the detection and mapping of ancient archaeological sites in the Amazon Basin using satellite imagery and other remote sensing techniques. While further research is needed, the studies reviewed here demonstrate the potential of this approach to assist in the discovery and preservation of Amazonian cultural heritage.
