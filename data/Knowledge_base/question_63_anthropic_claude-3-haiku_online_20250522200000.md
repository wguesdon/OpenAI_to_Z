# Predicting the Extent of Undiscovered Amazonian Dark Earths

## Question

What distance-decay threshold from documented Terra Preta patches correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features?

## Introduction

Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs), also known as Terra Preta, are anthropogenic soils found in the Amazon basin that are characterized by high levels of organic matter, charcoal, and nutrients. These soils are believed to have been created by ancient Amazonian populations through the deliberate incorporation of organic waste, charcoal, and other materials into the soil. Understanding the spatial distribution and extent of ADEs is important for reconstructing the history of human occupation and land use in the Amazon, as well as for understanding the potential of these soils as a carbon sink.

## Findings from the Literature

1. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3896013/?report=reader): The study indicates that terra pretas are likely to be found throughout ca 154,063 km^2 or 3.2% of the Amazon forest. The distribution of terra preta was highly predictable based on environmental parameters.

2. [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2010.512941): This study used a logistic model to create a predictive map of ADE location, using vegetation vigor as a surrogate for soil type.

3. [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259126195_Dark_earths_and_the_human_built_landscape_in_Amazonia_A_widespread_pattern_of_anthrosol_formation): This study provides photographic evidence of the Caldeirão archaeological site, showing excavations in a flat terrace and a mound, suggesting a widespread pattern of anthrosol formation.

4. [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.13116): This study found that Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) forests had, on average, higher aboveground biomass than other forests in southern Amazonia, while biomass was similar to that of non-ADE (NDE) forests in eastern Amazonia.

5. [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8499): This recent study provides evidence that ancient Amazonian populations intentionally created carbon-rich dark earth soils, and proposes a model for their formation.

## Analysis

The literature suggests that the distribution of Amazonian Dark Earths is highly predictable based on environmental parameters, and that they are likely to be found over a significant area of the Amazon basin (ca 154,063 km^2 or 3.2% of the forest). However, the exact distance-decay threshold from documented Terra Preta patches that correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features is not clearly stated.

The studies indicate that ADE soils can be detected using vegetation vigor as a proxy, and that they have distinct effects on forest structure and species composition. This suggests that a combination of environmental factors and remote sensing techniques could be used to identify potential areas of undiscovered ADE features.

## Conclusion

While the literature provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of Amazonian Dark Earths, the specific distance-decay threshold that correlates with a significant increase in undiscovered features is not clearly defined. Further research, potentially combining predictive modeling, remote sensing, and targeted field surveys, may be needed to determine this threshold and better estimate the full extent of ADE features in the Amazon basin.
