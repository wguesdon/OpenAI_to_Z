# Colonial-Era Maps Showing Settlements Not Present in Modern Records

**Question:**  
*Which colonial-era maps show settlements that don't appear in modern records?*

---

## Introduction

Colonial-era maps often captured settlements, villages, or indigenous habitations existing at the time but subsequently lost, displaced, or erased from modern documentation and archaeological records. These historical sources provide critical insights into past occupancy patterns, especially for indigenous or marginalized communities whose presence may have been diminished or overlooked in contemporary accounts.

## Findings from Historical and Scholarly Sources

### 1. Maps Documenting Mid-19th Century Native American Settlements in Central California

Research focusing on Tomales Bay in Central California indicates that several colonial-era maps depict indigenous settlements that have since disappeared from both archaeological and historical records. Specifically, designs and plats used during the Mexican land grant period and early maps produced by U.S. General Land Office and Coast Survey include locations of Native American communities:

- These maps often inconsistently recorded indigenous settlements, sometimes excluding them or inaccurately marking locations.
- Archaeologists have used a combination of historical maps and ground verification to rediscover sites that are poorly represented in modern records.
  
This research illustrates how colonial-era maps serve as a key tool to identify native habitation sites no longer evident in the modern archaeological record.

### 2. The Map of the Yurumanguí Indians (1742–1780)

A colonial-era map produced in the mid-18th century depicting the Yurumanguí Indians of the Pacific Lowlands reveals Native settlements that were eradicated or erased from later territory and census maps:

- The map, possibly composed from several pieces and refined versions, highlights settlements of an indigenous group known today as the Yurumanguí.
- Correspondence from that time discusses locations and features shown in the map but does not appear in modern records or indigenous nomenclature.
  
This map stands as a critical artifact charting indigenous habitation that modern records do not fully capture or recognize.

### 3. Early Maps of New South Wales Territory (Late 18th Century)

Colonial maps from the late 1700s, such as those produced around the establishment of the Port Jackson settlement (modern Sydney), show parts of the territory of New South Wales "seen by any person belonging to the settlement." These maps document Indigenous and settler placements from a period early in colonial occupation:

- Some maps show lands and settlements that have since shifted or vanished from official bounds or records.
- The detail and inclusion of geographic features and settlements help track indigenous and settler presence predating formal modern documentation.
  
Two notable maps from this era include:  
- "A map of all those parts of the territory of New South Wales…" by John Stockdale, 1792  
- "Map of the colony of New South Wales" dedicated to Sir John Barrow by Robert Dixon

## Conclusion

Several colonial-era maps can be identified as depicting settlements absent from modern records. These include:

- Mexican-era and early U.S. maps showing Native American communities in central California.
- The 18th-century map of the Yurumanguí Indians reflecting indigenous occupancy long since erased.
- Late 18th-century cartographic records of New South Wales showing indigenous and settler locations no longer visible in current records.

These maps remain invaluable to historians, archaeologists, and indigenous communities seeking to reclaim or rediscover lost histories.
