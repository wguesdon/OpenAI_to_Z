# Spatial Autocorrelation Between Confirmed Sites and Large Navigable Waterways (Main Stems vs. Secondary Tributaries)

## Restatement of the Question
**How strong is the spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways (main stems vs. secondary tributaries)?**

---

## Introduction

Spatial autocorrelation measures the degree to which geographically proximate locations share similar characteristics—in this case, the presence or attributes of confirmed sites relative to their proximity to large navigable waterways, distinguishing between main-stem rivers and secondary tributaries.

Understanding how confirmed sites (e.g., fish populations, habitats, ecological features) spatially correlate with main-stem and tributary waterways is critical for riverine ecology, conservation, and management. Main stems often represent large, interconnected river channels, while secondary tributaries may offer distinct or complementary habitats influencing spatial distribution of aquatic species or ecological conditions.

## Evidence from Literature

### Spatial Position and Autocorrelation in Stream Networks

- **Grenouillet et al. (2004)** found evidence of **significant spatial autocorrelation downstream**, specifically in higher-order streams (4th- to 7th-order), indicating that local habitat and biotic factors co-vary more strongly in larger stream orders, i.e., main stems, than in smaller tributary channels. This suggests stronger spatial autocorrelation in main-stem sites compared to secondary tributaries within stream networks [nrc-cnrc.gc.ca](https://nrc-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1139/f03-145).

- **Thornbrugh & Gido (2009)** reported that fish assemblage structure showed significantly higher species richness and distinct composition in tributary segments directly connected to larger ordered main-stem rivers. They observed spatial patterns where assemblages abruptly change at confluences, followed by gradual change with distance upstream in tributaries. This supports the idea that spatial autocorrelation is strong near main-stem and tributary confluences but may weaken farther into secondary tributaries [nrc-cnrc.gc.ca](https://nrc-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1139/F09-169).

- The spatial structure of fish populations across main-stem and tributary habitats suggests connectivity is crucial, with life-history strategies depending on habitat linkage between the main stem and tributaries, impacting spatial distribution and autocorrelation of species presence [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.3289).

### Connectivity and Tributary Impact

- Tributaries contribute spatially distinct ecological conditions impacting downstream main-stem rivers. However, the tributary impacts can be spatially identified, showing certain tributaries influence main-stem habitat conditions disproportionately due to their spatial position, i.e., near confluences [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470760383.ch9).

- Some studies indicate that undammed tributaries provide access to less impacted habitats, which could foster unique spatial autocorrelation patterns in tributaries different from those found in managed or dammed main stems [wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.3711).

## Synthesis: Strength of Spatial Autocorrelation

- **Main-stem waterways (large navigable rivers)** exhibit **stronger spatial autocorrelation** in terms of ecological and species assemblage patterns, especially downstream and near confluences with tributaries. This is likely due to larger scale habitat continuity and higher connectivity.

- **Secondary tributaries** show **weaker spatial autocorrelation** compared to main stems, with more localized variability. However, tributaries near confluences with main-stem rivers can display stronger spatial autocorrelation as assemblages change abruptly near these junctions.

- Overall, spatial autocorrelation is influenced not only by waterway order (main stem vs. tributary) but also by proximity to confluences, connectivity, habitat characteristics, and anthropogenic impacts.

## Conclusion

The spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways is generally **stronger in main-stem rivers** than in secondary tributaries. However, tributaries close to main-stem confluences exhibit pronounced spatial patterns that moderate this difference. The spatial structure of ecological conditions and species assemblages reflects both connectivity and local habitat variation along these waterway types.
