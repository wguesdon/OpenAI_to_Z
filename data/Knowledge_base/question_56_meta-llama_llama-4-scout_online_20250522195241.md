Identifying Anthropogenic Features under Forest Canopy using Machine Learning Architectures
=====================================================================================

### Question

What machine learning architectures work best for identifying anthropogenic features under forest canopy?

### Introduction

The identification of anthropogenic features under forest canopy is a challenging task due to the complexity of forest ecosystems and the limitations of remote sensing data. Machine learning architectures have been widely used for this purpose, and various studies have explored their effectiveness. This report aims to provide an overview of the machine learning architectures that work best for identifying anthropogenic features under forest canopy.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs have been widely used for image classification tasks, including the identification of anthropogenic features under forest canopy. They are particularly effective in extracting features from high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10725256/). CNNs can be trained using weakly-supervised learning approaches, where the network is trained on image-level labels and then used to extract features at the pixel level.

### Deep Learning Architectures

Deep learning architectures, such as U-Net-like CNNs, have been used for semantic segmentation tasks, including the identification of windthrow areas and forest roads [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/7/1145). These architectures are effective in precisely segmenting remote sensing data and can be used to identify anthropogenic features under forest canopy.

### Hybrid Classification Approaches

Hybrid classification approaches, combining multiple machine learning algorithms, have been used for identifying anthropogenic features under forest canopy. For example, a study used a combination of LiDAR data and machine learning algorithms to detect forest roads [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/3/393).

### Semantic Mapping of Landscape Morphologies

Semantic mapping of landscape morphologies using machine learning and remote sensing data has also been explored [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/19/3572). This approach involves using machine learning algorithms to classify landscape features, including anthropogenic features, using high-resolution elevation data.

### Conclusion

The machine learning architectures that work best for identifying anthropogenic features under forest canopy are:

* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Deep learning architectures, such as U-Net-like CNNs
* Hybrid classification approaches
* Semantic mapping of landscape morphologies using machine learning and remote sensing data

These architectures have been shown to be effective in extracting features from remote sensing data and identifying anthropogenic features under forest canopy.
