## Percy Fawcett and the Search for "Z"

[jasoncolavito.com](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/percy-fawcett-victim-of-a-theosophical-obsession) reports that Fawcett believed "Z" to be the capital of a vast, ancient civilization that he thought existed in the Amazon basin. According to the blog post, Fawcett had come across a mysterious document known as "Manuscript 512" which described a lost city with "arches and domes, statues, and mysterious hieroglyphic engravings." Fawcett believed this city was merely an outpost of the larger civilization he called "Z".

[jasoncolavito.com](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/a-plausible-explanation-for-the-lost-city-of-manuscript-512) provides more details on Fawcett's search for "Z". It states that Fawcett thought "Z" to be the capital of this vast civilization, and that he was driven by a "theosophical obsession" to find it. The blog post also mentions that in 2019, Brazilian media suggested the real location of the city described in "Manuscript 512" may have been an area called Gentio do Ouro, adjacent to Xique-Xique in the state of Bahia.

Unfortunately, the sources found do not provide many direct quotes or details from Fawcett's own journals and correspondence about his observations and beliefs regarding "Z". The information seems to come more from secondary sources analyzing Fawcett's explorations and theories.
