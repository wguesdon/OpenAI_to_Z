# Amazonian Dark Earths and Their Use in Detecting Archaeological Sites
## Introduction

Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are a type of soil found in the Amazon region, characterized by their dark color and high fertility. They are formed through the accumulation of organic matter and nutrients over thousands of years, often as a result of human habitation and land use.

## What are Amazonian Dark Earths?

Amazonian Dark Earths are areas of soil that have been enriched with nutrients and organic matter, making them highly fertile. These soils are typically found near ancient human settlements and are thought to have been created through the accumulation of waste, such as fish and animal bones, charcoal, and other organic materials [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/2012/12/satellite-sensing-black-earth-amazon/?cid=4800984). The presence of ADEs is often associated with archaeological sites, as they are a byproduct of human activity.

## Can Amazonian Dark Earths be used to detect Amazonian archaeological sites from satellite images?

Recent studies have shown that it is possible to detect ADEs and, by extension, Amazonian archaeological sites using satellite images. Researchers have used machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite data and identify areas with characteristics consistent with ADEs [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020851). These characteristics include differences in soil color, vegetation, and topography.

The use of satellite imaging to detect ADEs and archaeological sites has several advantages, including:

* **Cost-effectiveness**: Satellite imaging is a cost-effective way to survey large areas, reducing the need for ground-based surveys.
* **Efficiency**: Satellite imaging can quickly cover large areas, allowing researchers to identify potential sites of interest.
* **Accuracy**: Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in satellite data that are indicative of ADEs and archaeological sites.

## Methods and Results

Researchers have used a variety of methods to detect ADEs and archaeological sites from satellite images, including:

* **Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging**: These techniques involve analyzing the reflectance of light by the Earth's surface at different wavelengths.
* **Machine learning algorithms**: These algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns in satellite data that are indicative of ADEs and archaeological sites.

Studies have shown that these methods can be effective in detecting ADEs and archaeological sites. For example, one study used a machine learning algorithm to analyze satellite data and identify areas with characteristics consistent with ADEs [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020851). The algorithm was able to detect 13 new geoglyphs and pinpoint areas with high probabilities of undiscovered archaeological sites.

## Conclusion

Amazonian Dark Earths are a valuable resource for understanding the history and ecology of the Amazon region. The use of satellite imaging to detect ADEs and archaeological sites is a promising approach that can help researchers identify new sites and gain a better understanding of the region's cultural and environmental history.
