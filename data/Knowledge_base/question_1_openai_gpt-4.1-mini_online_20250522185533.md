## What Are Amazonian Dark Earths?

Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs), also known as terra preta, are distinctive, nutrient-rich soils found primarily in the Amazon rainforest. They were formed through long-term human habitation and activity thousands of years ago. Characteristics of ADEs include:

- **Anthropogenic Origin**: These soils are enriched by the deposition of organic waste such as charcoal, animal bones, fish remains, and other artifacts from pre-Columbian indigenous settlements.
- **Soil Enrichment**: While typical Amazon soils are nutrient-poor, ADEs are highly fertile with significantly enriched levels of phosphorus, calcium, and carbon, sometimes called "black gold" due to their richness.
- **Longevity**: ADE sites vary in age from approximately 500 to over 2,000 years and maintain their fertility over extensive periods, indicating a lasting legacy of past human environmental management.

Research has suggested that ADEs result from complex interactions involving both natural and human influences, including alluvial deposits and anthropic activities linked to forest management and cultivation practices. Specifically, some studies argue that indigenous peoples harnessed natural geological processes combined with their practices to create these fertile soils rather than solely generating them via direct soil management [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20184-2.pdf), [ui.adsabs.harvard.edu](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatCo..12..127S).

## Detecting Archaeological Sites Using Amazonian Dark Earths and Satellite Images

ADEs mark the locations of pre-Columbian settlements and carry unique spectral and compositional properties that make them identifiable through remote sensing technologies. Their detection involves:

- **Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery**: The distinct soil color, vegetation variations, and nutrient profiles associated with ADEs alter local vegetation vigor and soil spectral signatures, which can be detected from satellite images using different spectral bands.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Advanced classification algorithms, trained on soil types, vegetation indices, climate data, and proximity to water sources, help predict the probable locations of ADEs and associated anthropogenic earthworks. These models have achieved high accuracy (Area Under Curve around 0.91), facilitating the discovery of previously unknown archaeological sites hidden under dense rainforest canopies [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020851).

- **Enhanced Vegetation Indices and Soil Data Integration**: Research on forest management areas like the Floresta Nacional de Caxiuan√£ has combined satellite-derived vegetation indices with geospatial soil properties to calibrate and detect long-term anthropogenic modifications, including ADE formation [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320301618).

- **Practical Discoveries**: Utilizing these approaches, researchers have successfully pinpointed locations of ADE patches and related geoglyphs (earthworks) in the Amazon. These findings not only reveal sites of ancient human activity but also guide preservation efforts by identifying regions with likely undiscovered archaeological features beneath the rainforest canopy.

## Summary

- **Amazonian Dark Earths** are nutrient-rich soils formed through ancient human activity combined with natural processes, marked by high levels of organic material and minerals.
- These soils serve as **indicators of ancient Amazonian settlements** due to their unique composition and long-lasting fertility.
- Through **satellite remote sensing, vegetation indices, and machine learning techniques**, ADEs can be detected from space, enabling archaeologists to locate and preserve hidden archaeological sites under dense forest cover.
