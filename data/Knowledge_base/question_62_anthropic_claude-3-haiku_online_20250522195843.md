## Evaluating the Spatial Autocorrelation between Confirmed Sites and Large Navigable Waterways

### Question
How strong is the spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways (main stems vs. secondary tributaries)?

### Summary
This report explores the spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways, specifically comparing the relationships between main stems and secondary tributaries. By incorporating insights from the provided web search results, the report examines the complex interactions between spatial scale, network structure, and landscape characteristics in river systems, and how these factors influence the spatial patterns of biotic interactions and ecological conditions.

### Spatial Autocorrelation in River Networks
The web search results highlight the importance of considering spatial autocorrelation when analyzing data in river networks. Spatial statistical network models have been developed to account for the nonindependence of measurements in stream data due to the dendritic structure of river systems [research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/45559]. These models can be applied to various stream attributes, such as water quality, habitat conditions, and biological surveys, to improve predictions and aid in the design of efficient monitoring strategies.

The literature also suggests that the spatial extent of biotic interactions, such as the relationship between a freshwater mussel and its host fish, can have a significant impact on species distribution and abundance in river networks [onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12435]. Incorporating these biotic interactions into species distribution models can improve their predictive performance compared to models based solely on abiotic factors.

### Tributary Effects in River Networks
The web search results indicate that the spatial scale and network structure of river systems play an important role in understanding the effects of tributaries on longitudinal patterns in the main stem. Smaller, more diverse headwater streams are more likely to exhibit abrupt changes, while the numerous small tributaries flowing into large main stem channels typically cause gradual, yet collectively significant, changes in longitudinal patterns [nrc-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0493].

Additionally, the presence of undammed tributary rivers can provide access to less-impacted habitats for riverine fishes, highlighting the importance of accounting for both dispersal and local habitat characteristics when evaluating tributary use [onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.3711].

### Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that the spatial autocorrelation between confirmed sites and large navigable waterways is likely to be influenced by the complex interactions between spatial scale, network structure, and landscape characteristics in river systems. The strength of the autocorrelation may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the main stems and secondary tributaries, as well as the biotic and abiotic factors that shape the distribution and abundance of species within the river network.

Further research using spatial statistical network models and incorporating both biotic and abiotic predictors would be needed to quantify the precise strength of the spatial autocorrelation and how it differs between main stems and secondary tributaries.
