# Comprehensive Report: Clusters of Non-Natural Soil Mounds (Terra Preta) in the Amazon Region

## Introduction

The question at hand is to identify clusters of non-natural soil mounds, also known as "terras pretas" or Amazonian Dark Earths, that are visible on soil maps but have not been tested archaeologically. These soil formations are of great interest due to their unique properties and the insights they provide into pre-Columbian land use and settlement patterns in the Amazon region.

## Background

Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile, dark-colored soils found in the Amazon basin. They are considered to be anthropogenic, created by the accumulation of organic matter and charcoal from human activities, such as waste management and agriculture, over centuries. These soils are highly fertile and can support intensive agriculture, making them valuable for sustainable land use in the region.

## Locations of Terra Preta

Several studies have mapped the distribution of ADEs in the Brazilian Amazon and other parts of the Amazon region. 

- **Distribution in the Brazilian Amazon**: Research conducted by [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon) provides a map of the distribution of archaeological sites in the region of the Tocantins river (Par√° State), which includes areas with Amazonian Dark Earths.
- **Monumental Mounds Region of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivian Amazon**: A study published on [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/7054791/Soil_properties_and_pre-Columbian_settlement_patterns_in_the_Monumental_Mounds_Region_of_the_Llanos_de_Moxos_Bolivian_Amazon) discusses soil properties and pre-Columbian settlement patterns in this region, highlighting the presence of raised fields that could be associated with terra preta.

## Unexplored Clusters

While specific, untested clusters of terra preta are not directly mentioned in the provided search results, the studies cited offer insights into regions where such formations might exist. For instance, the [gerhardbechtold.com](https://gerhardbechtold.com/TP/BrazilTP3.php) website provides information on Terra Preta sites in Brazil, which could be a starting point for identifying unexplored areas.

## Conclusion

Based on the available information, it appears that there are several regions within the Amazon basin where terra preta formations have been identified, but not all have been subjected to archaeological testing. Further research and fieldwork are necessary to explore these areas fully and uncover the secrets they hold about pre-Columbian civilizations.
