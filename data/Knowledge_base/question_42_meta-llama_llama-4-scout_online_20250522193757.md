# Collaborative Archaeology and Indigenous Mapping Methods
## Introduction

Recent collaborative archaeology projects have increasingly integrated Indigenous mapping methods, such as oral cartography, to incorporate the perspectives and knowledge of Indigenous peoples into the research process. This approach recognizes the importance of Indigenous knowledge and rights to their ancestral lands.

## Collaborative Archaeology and Indigenous Mapping

Collaborative archaeology seeks to center Indigenous peoples' and research partners' goals, perspectives, and concerns while decentering archaeological agendas alone [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1426294/full). This approach involves co-creating research questions, formalizing agreements regarding culturally appropriate field and laboratory methods, and shared authorship of academic manuscripts.

Indigenous mapping methods, such as oral cartography, have been used to document and preserve Indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage. For example, the Stz'uminus Storied Places Project used participatory mapping to mobilize Indigenous place names and place-based stories [journals.uvic.ca](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/arbutus/article/download/13300/4192). This project demonstrated the importance of Indigenous place names as "houses for layers of information, including cultural and historical knowledge, environmental conditions, availability of resources, and Aboriginal identity."

## Case Studies

Several recent collaborative archaeology projects have integrated Indigenous mapping methods:

* The **Westbank First Nation** project in British Columbia, Canada, used a secure digital platform to enable the nation to interact with and use archaeological information, and provide training in digital methods and practice [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9702736/).
* The **Stz'uminus Storied Places Project** in British Columbia, Canada, used participatory mapping to document Indigenous place names and place-based stories [journals.uvic.ca](https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/arbutus/article/download/13300/4192).
* The **Hastings Natural History Reservation** project in California, USA, used collaborative archaeology principles to center Indigenous peoples' goals, perspectives, and concerns [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-archaeology/articles/10.3389/fearc.2024.1426294/full).
* The **Barapa Country** project in Australia used participatory cultural mapping to identify and map cultural assets on traditional lands [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445647.2019.1701574).
* The **Engaged Archaeology** project in the Upper Maroni River Basin, Northern Amazonia, used participatory mapping to engage with indigenous people and share research agendas [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/8804341).

## Conclusion

Recent collaborative archaeology projects have successfully integrated Indigenous mapping methods, such as oral cartography, to incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the research process. These projects demonstrate the importance of collaborative approaches and Indigenous-led research initiatives.
