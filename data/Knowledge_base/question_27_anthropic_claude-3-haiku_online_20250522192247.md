# Identifying Untested Amazonian Dark Earth Sites from Soil Maps

## Question
Which clusters of non-natural soil mounds (terras pretas) are visible on soil maps but untested archaeologically?

## Introduction
Amazonian Dark Earths, also known as terras pretas, are anthropogenic soils found in the Amazon basin that are characterized by a dark, nutrient-rich composition. These soils were created through the accumulation of organic matter, charcoal, and other human-generated materials over centuries of habitation and agricultural practices by pre-Columbian Amazonian societies. 

While many Amazonian Dark Earth sites have been identified and studied, there are likely still undiscovered or untested sites visible on soil maps that warrant further archaeological investigation. This report aims to examine the available research on the distribution and mapping of Amazonian Dark Earths to identify potential clusters of untested sites.

## Mapping the Distribution of Amazonian Dark Earths
Several studies have mapped the distribution of Amazonian Dark Earths in the Brazilian Amazon region:

[Söderström et al. (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706116302725) used remote sensing and soil sampling to map the location of Amazonian Dark Earths in deforested croplands near Santarém, Brazil. They found that Dark Earths were often located in areas with past human habitation and agricultural activities.

[Rebellato et al. (2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon) compiled a map of archaeological sites containing Amazonian Dark Earths in the region of the Tocantins river in Pará state, Brazil. This map showed clusters of sites, indicating potential areas for further exploration.

[Bechtold (2008)](https://gerhardbechtold.com/TP/BrazilTP3.php) maintained a website cataloging known Amazonian Dark Earth sites in Brazil, though it is unclear if all sites have been archaeologically tested.

## Potential Untested Sites
Based on the mapping efforts described above, some potential clusters of Amazonian Dark Earths that may be untested archaeologically include:

1. The region around the Tocantins river in Pará state, as identified by Rebellato et al. (2009). This area showed numerous archaeological sites containing Dark Earths, but it is unclear if all have been extensively tested.

2. Areas of deforested cropland near Santarém, Brazil, as mapped by Söderström et al. (2016). While the authors identified Dark Earths in this region, there may be additional untested sites in the broader area.

3. Other regions of the Brazilian Amazon not covered by the above studies, as the full distribution of Amazonian Dark Earths is still being uncovered.

Further archaeological survey and testing in these and other regions with suspected Amazonian Dark Earth deposits could help identify additional untested sites and expand our understanding of pre-Columbian land use and soil management practices in the Amazon basin.
