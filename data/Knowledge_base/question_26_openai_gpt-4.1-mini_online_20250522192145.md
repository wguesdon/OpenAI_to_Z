# Indigenous Communities' Reports of Ancestral Sites Without Formal Archaeological Documentation

## Question Restatement
Where have Indigenous communities reported ancestral sites that archaeologists haven't formally documented?

## Introduction
Various Indigenous communities across Canada have reported ancestral sites, including burial grounds, artifacts, and culturally significant landscapes, that have not been formally documented by archaeologists or have been inadequately assessed by external researchers. These sites hold immense cultural, spiritual, and historical significance for Indigenous peoples and often challenge ongoing development or resource extraction projects.

## Reported Sites by Indigenous Communities

### 1. Wet’suwet’en Territory - British Columbia
- **Context**: The Wet’suwet’en people have reported significant ancestral sites on their traditional lands, including stone tool artifacts and other cultural resources.
- **Details**: Artifacts from the Shuswap Horizon (approximately 3500–2400 years before present) were discovered at a construction site for the Coastal GasLink pipeline project on the Unist’ot’en territory. These artifacts include trails, villages, food resources, and cultural infrastructure intimately tied to Wet’suwet’en identity.
- **Archaeological Documentation**: Coastal GasLink's archaeological overview assessment was conducted remotely without on-the-ground archaeological data gathering, resulting in criticism from the Wet’suwet’en about the lack of proper consultation and investigation.
- **Significance**: The Wet’suwet’en emphasize the importance of preserving these sites as evidence of their ancestral heritage and control over their territories.
- **References**:  
  - Open Letter to BC Ministry of Forests: Stone tools and cultural sites reported but largely undocumented on-site.  
  - Significant Archaeological Finding Pauses Work: Indigenous reports and demands for proper archaeological investigation at pipeline project sites.

### 2. Papaschase First Nation - Edmonton, Alberta
- **Context**: Papaschase First Nation has identified a potential burial site in the Edmonton area.
- **Details**: The community believes they have located ancestral burial grounds on land where access has been limited by current landowners. They hope for cooperative efforts to allow for an archaeological assessment to confirm and protect the site.
- **Archaeological Documentation**: The site remains largely undocumented archaeologically due to restricted access and ongoing negotiations.
- **Significance**: The site is crucial for understanding Papaschase heritage and for cultural and legal recognition.

### 3. Sumas First Nation - Abbotsford, British Columbia
- **Context**: In Abbotsford, Sumas First Nation has reported ancestral gravesites including burial mounds.
- **Details**: Archaeologists later discovered more than 40 earthen mounds believed to be burial mounds related to a smallpox epidemic in 1782. Additionally, culturally modified trees and a spiritual "transformer" rock were identified, all of which were deeply significant to the First Nation.
- **Archaeological Documentation**: While these findings were eventually documented by archaeologists, they initially grew out of Indigenous knowledge and oral histories rather than formal archaeological surveys.
- **Significance**: The discovery halted a $40 million development project, highlighting the clash between urban development and Indigenous heritage protection.

## Summary and Conclusion
Indigenous communities have reported numerous ancestral and culturally important sites across Canada—including the Wet’suwet’en territory in British Columbia, Papaschase First Nation lands in Alberta, and Sumas First Nation sites in British Columbia—that have not been fully or adequately documented through formal archaeological processes. These reports underscore the ongoing need for collaborative, ground-level archaeological investigations that respect Indigenous knowledge systems and legal rights, as well as the powerful role Indigenous communities play in heritage protection.
