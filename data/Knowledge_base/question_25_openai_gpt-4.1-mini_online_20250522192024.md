# Geographic Areas with High Potential for Archaeological Sites but Remain Unsurveyed

**Question:**  
*What geographic areas have high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed?*

---

## Introduction

Identifying geographic regions with high archaeological potential that remain unsurveyed is crucial for advancing our understanding of human history and prehistory. Recent advances in technology, such as Lidar, and ongoing research hint at several such areas, particularly in regions where historical occupation occurred but systematic surveys are incomplete or have yet to be conducted.

## High-Potential Yet Undersurveyed Geographic Areas

### 1. Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia)

- **Background:**  
  The Llanos de Moxos region in Bolivia is a vast tropical wetland that was densely populated by indigenous peoples until the Spanish arrival in the late 17th century. Archaeological evidence dates back as far as 8000 BC with monumental mounds dating to around 800 BC. 
  
- **Undersurveyed Status:**  
  Despite its rich archaeological legacy, much of this area remains poorly investigated, with many sites yet to be surveyed.
  
- **Potential:**  
  Recent Lidar data obtained in 2022 has revealed new sites that could shed light on long-prehistoric occupation patterns and complex societies in this region.

  See detailed archaeological information on Llanos de Moxos in the [Wikipedia article on Llanos de Moxos (archaeology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanos_de_Moxos_(archaeology)).

### 2. Four Corners Region (United States)

- **Background:**  
  This region in the southwestern United States, where Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah meet, has a rich Native American and prehistoric archaeological record.
  
- **Undersurveyed Status:**  
  While studied extensively in parts, many peripheral and remote areas in the Four Corners region remain undersurveyed due to difficult terrain, limited access, or lack of focused archaeological projects.
  
- **Potential:**  
  Potential exists for discovery of unknown settlements, trade routes, and cultural artifacts.

  Metadata and survey status related to this area can be found at the [Center for Digital Antiquity Four Corners Region resource](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/16498/four-corners-region).

### 3. Great Plains (United States)

- **Background:**  
  The Great Plains cover a vast area of central North America with a rich prehistoric and historic record, including indigenous occupation and early farming communities.
  
- **Undersurveyed Status:**  
  Because of the regionâ€™s huge expanse, many parts of the Great Plains have not been systematically surveyed or excavated.
  
- **Potential:**  
  There is ongoing potential to find habitation sites, burial grounds, and artifacts linked to both nomadic and sedentary cultures.

  Survey status and potential for archaeological work in the Great Plains can be reviewed via [Center for Digital Antiquity Great Plains resource](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/2901/great-plains).

### 4. Colorado Plateau (United States)

- **Background:**  
  The Colorado Plateau is known for significant archaeological resources, including cliff dwellings and rock art associated with the Ancestral Puebloans and other Native American groups.
  
- **Undersurveyed Status:**  
  Certain areas, particularly those proposed for development or resource exploration, have data gaps because of restricted access or lack of comprehensive survey efforts.
  
- **Potential:**  
  Archaeological sites may be uncovered through targeted reconnaissance, potentially illuminating additional cultural and historical contexts.

- **Reference:**  
  Detailed report collection and resource listings for this region are available through the [Center for Digital Antiquity Colorado Plateau resource](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/3733/colorado-plateau).

### 5. Lesser-Surveyed Counties Such as Cibola County, New Mexico

- **Background:**  
  Cibola County in New Mexico forms part of the region rich in archaeological heritage but with limited current survey coverage.
  
- **Undersurveyed Status:**  
  The county and similar administrative zones may have peripheral areas with archaeological significance but lack thorough documentation.
  
- **Potential:**  
  May host unknown prehistoric sites or historical Native American remains.

  For additional data refer to [Center for Digital Antiquity Cibola County resource](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/247/cibola-county-county).

## Summary and Outlook

Regions like the **Llanos de Moxos in Bolivia** stand out as key high-potential zones where new technologies such as Lidar promise to deliver major archaeological discoveries. In the United States, large, diverse territories including the **Four Corners**, **Great Plains**, and **Colorado Plateau** have areas with known gaps and opportunities for future survey work. County-level gaps, such as those in **Cibola County** and similarly less-surveyed administrative units, also present opportunities for targeted archaeological investigations.

Systematic surveys, especially those integrating new remote sensing technologies and community collaborations, will be critical in uncovering and preserving the archaeological heritage housed in these undersurveyed regions.
