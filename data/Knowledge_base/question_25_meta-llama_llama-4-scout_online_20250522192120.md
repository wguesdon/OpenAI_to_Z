# Geographic Areas with High Potential for Archaeological Sites but Remain Unsurveyed
## Introduction

The question of which geographic areas have high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed is crucial for researchers and archaeologists. These areas can provide valuable insights into past human cultures and civilizations.

## Areas with High Potential

Several geographic areas have been identified as having a high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed. Some of these areas include:

### Llanos de Moxos

The Llanos de Moxos region in Bolivia is one such area. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanos_de_Moxos_(archaeology)) Recent Lidar data has revealed much about sites that have not been investigated, providing a clearer understanding of prehistoric cultures in the region. Evidence of human habitation dates back to 8000 BC, with artifacts found in monumental mounds dating to as early as 800 BC.

### Four Corners Region

The Four Corners region of the southwestern United States is another area with a high potential for archaeological sites.

### Colorado Plateau

The Colorado Plateau region of the southwestern United States is another area with a high potential for archaeological sites. [core.tdar.org](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/3733/colorado-plateau) This region has been home to numerous Native American cultures, including the Ancestral Puebloans, and its rugged terrain has preserved many archaeological sites.

### Cibola County

Cibola County in New Mexico is also an area with a high potential for archaeological sites.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, several geographic areas have been identified as having a high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed. These areas include the Llanos de Moxos, Four Corners region, Great Plains, Colorado Plateau, and Cibola County. Further research and surveys are needed to uncover the secrets of these regions and provide a better understanding of past human cultures.
