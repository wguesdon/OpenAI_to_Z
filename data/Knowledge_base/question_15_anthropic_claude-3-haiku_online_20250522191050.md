# Exploring National and State-Level Open Data Portals for Ancillary Geospatial Layers

## Question

What national or state-level open-data portals provide ancillary layers (hydrology, soils, roads, deforestation) that could help in site prediction?

## Introduction

To answer this question, I have reviewed the search results provided and synthesized the key information on national and state-level open data portals that offer ancillary geospatial layers that could be useful for site prediction.

## Findings

Based on the web search results, the following open data portals provide access to a variety of ancillary geospatial layers that could be helpful for site prediction:

1. **[GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/)**: The GeoPlatform.gov website is a federal geospatial data platform that provides access to a range of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data, including the GeoPlatform STAC (Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog) and the GeoPlatform API, which can be used to discover and access geospatial data.

2. **[USDA:NRCS:Geospatial Data Gateway](https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov/)**: The Geospatial Data Gateway (GDG) from the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides access to a variety of environmental and natural resources data, including high-resolution vector and raster layers in the Geospatial Data Warehouse. This includes data such as DRGs (Digital Raster Graphics), NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery, and the National Elevation Database (NED).

3. **[California State Geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/)**: The California State Geoportal offers access to geospatial data through the use of the OGC Records API, which allows users to discover geospatial resources through standardized collections and resources metadata.

4. **[Washington State Geospatial Open Data Portal](https://geo.wa.gov/)**: The Washington State Geospatial Open Data Portal provides access to geospatial data through the use of DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary) feeds, which can be used to federate the site's content with external data catalogs, such as data.gov or data.europa.eu. The portal also offers the OGC Records API for discovering geospatial resources.

5. **[Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Geospatial Business Platform Hub](https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/)**: The BLM Geospatial Business Platform Hub serves as a centralized location to explore, view, and download geospatial data from the Bureau of Land Management, including data at the national and state levels, as well as through BLM's landscape initiatives.

These portals provide access to a wide range of ancillary geospatial layers that could be useful for site prediction, such as hydrology, soils, roads, and land cover/deforestation data. Users can search for and download these datasets to incorporate them into their site prediction models and analyses.

## Conclusion

The web search results highlight several national and state-level open data portals that offer access to a variety of ancillary geospatial layers, including hydrology, soils, roads, and deforestation data. These resources can be valuable for incorporating additional contextual information into site prediction models and analyses.
