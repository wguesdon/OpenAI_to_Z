Soil-Fertility Maps and Anthropogenic Dark Earths: An Overlapping Analysis
====================================================================

### Introduction

Anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs) are fertile soils created by human activities, particularly in the Amazon region. These soils are characterized by high levels of phosphorus, organic carbon, and other nutrients, making them suitable for agriculture. This report examines the overlap between soil-fertility maps and clusters of ADEs, highlighting the relationships between these two factors.

### Background

ADEs are a type of anthropic soil that has been enriched with organic matter and nutrients through human activities, such as waste management and agricultural practices [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117320700). These soils are found in various parts of the Amazon region, including Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.

### Soil-Fertility Maps

Soil-fertility maps are used to identify areas with high levels of nutrients, such as phosphorus and organic carbon. These maps are essential for agricultural planning and management, as they help identify areas suitable for crop production [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon).

### Overlapping Analysis

Studies have shown that ADEs tend to overlap with areas of high soil fertility, particularly in terms of phosphorus and organic carbon [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312005523). For example, a study in the Brazilian Amazon found that ADEs were concentrated in areas with high levels of phosphorus and organic carbon [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259126195_Dark_earths_and_the_human_built_landscape_in_Amazonia_A_widespread_pattern_of_anthrosol_formation).

### Spatial Distribution

The spatial distribution of ADEs and soil-fertility maps shows a significant overlap, particularly in areas with high levels of phosphorus and organic carbon [soil.copernicus.org](https://soil.copernicus.org/preprints/soil-2019-26/). For example, a study in southern Amazonas, Brazil, found that ADEs were concentrated in areas with high levels of phosphorus and organic carbon, and that these areas were often associated with prehistoric settlement patterns [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312005523).

### Conclusion

In conclusion, soil-fertility maps and clusters of ADEs show a significant overlap, particularly in terms of phosphorus and organic carbon. This overlap is due to the fact that ADEs are created through human activities that enrich the soil with organic matter and nutrients. Understanding the relationships between soil-fertility maps and ADEs can provide valuable insights for agricultural planning and management, as well as for the conservation of these fertile soils.
