# Revealing Erasures: Colonial-Era Maps and Missing Indigenous Settlements

## Question
Which colonial-era maps show settlements that don't appear in modern records?

## Introduction
The erasure of Indigenous populations and settlements from historical records and maps is a well-documented phenomenon of colonial expansion. This report examines several studies that explore how colonial-era maps can shed light on previously undocumented or 'missing' Indigenous settlements.

## Findings

### The Map of the Yurumanguí Indians
[Wiersema (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00822884.2020.1774964) analyzes a colonial-era map of the Yurumanguí Indians in the Pacific lowlands of Colombia. The map, compiled in 1742-1780, provides detailed information about the locations of Indigenous settlements that are not found in other historical records from the period. The author suggests the map may have been compiled from multiple sources and represents a more comprehensive view of the region's Indigenous geography than what is typically documented.

### Mapping Native Settlements in Central California
[Panich et al. (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1416849) explore how historical maps, particularly Mexican-era land grant documents and early US government surveys, can aid archaeologists in locating mid-19th century Native American settlements in central California. The authors note that while historical maps are inconsistent in their depiction of Indigenous communities, targeted archaeological investigation informed by these maps can uncover sites that are poorly represented in other historical records.

### Unveiling Southern Africa
[Liebenberg (2021)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23729333.2021.1922808) discusses how John Barrow's 1801 map of Southern Africa helped fill in many gaps in the European cartographic knowledge of the region. Prior to this map, the interior of Southern Africa was largely unknown to Europeans, and Barrow's work allowed local mapmakers and international cartographers to add significant detail to maps of the area based on direct observation and survey.

### The Earliest Permanent Settlement in Carolina
[Barrs (1451)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1905050?origin=crossref) provides an example of how historical maps can reveal information about early colonial settlements that are not well-documented in other sources. The author analyzes the Comberford map, which depicts an early permanent English settlement in Carolina that is not mentioned in many other historical accounts.

## Conclusion
The studies reviewed in this report demonstrate that colonial-era maps can be a valuable resource for uncovering information about Indigenous settlements and communities that are often missing from or underrepresented in modern historical records. By closely analyzing the content and context of these historical maps, researchers can gain important insights into the geographic distributions and persistence of native populations during the colonial period.
