# Locations Matching Historical Accounts Yet to be Verified

## Question
What locations match descriptions from historical accounts but haven't been verified on the ground?

## Introduction
This report explores several locations that have been described in historical accounts, but their identities have not been conclusively verified through on-the-ground exploration and investigation. The report synthesizes information from various web sources to provide an overview of these enigmatic locations.

## Quivira
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quivira) provides information about the historical location of Quivira, which was encountered by the Spanish explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado in the 16th century. Quivira was described as a settlement of the Wichita people, but its exact location remains uncertain. The article notes that the "origin of the word 'Quivira' is uncertain" and that the inhabitants "called themselves 'Tancoa' and 'Tabas'." The reasons for the Wichita's movement and the decline in their population during the 18th century are also discussed, including the possible impacts of European diseases like smallpox.

## Beechland
The website [Lost-Colony.com](https://www.lost-colony.com/Beechland.html) presents information about the historical settlement of Beechland, which is said to have been founded by English colonists who fled the lost Roanoke colony. According to the account, the settlement was located in an area known as Beechland, and the author's grandfather, who had married a "full-blooded Indian from Beechland," attested to the existence of the settlement when the author was a child. The article describes the Beechland settlement as containing several log houses, some with dirt floors, but the exact location of this site has not been conclusively verified.

## Nephi's Bountiful
The website [ScriptureCentral.org](https://scripturecentral.org/knowhy/has-the-location-of-nephis-bountiful-been-discovered) discusses the efforts to identify the location of Nephi's Bountiful, a place described in the Book of Mormon. The article suggests that the region of Dhofar in modern-day Oman, specifically the Wadi Sayq area, may correspond to the descriptions of Bountiful provided in the scriptures. The article cites the work of researcher Warren Aston, who has explored this region and found features that align with the scriptural accounts, such as the presence of lush vegetation, fresh water, and resources suitable for shipbuilding.

## Mount Sinai
The [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14708717/Mount-Sinai-Moses-received-Ten-Commandments-God.html) article discusses the ongoing efforts to identify the true location of Mount Sinai, where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments from God. The article mentions the "Split Rock" near a mountain in the region as a potential clue, as it aligns with the biblical account of Moses striking a rock to provide water for the Israelites. However, the exact location of this biblical event has not been conclusively verified.

## Kincaid's 'Cave'
The [Bibliotecapleyades.net](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_orionzone_9.htm) website provides information about the location of Kincaid's 'Cave', which is described as a site that was discovered in the Grand Canyon in the early 20th century. The article suggests that the location referred to as "Crystal Canyon" likely refers to the canyon where Crystal Creek flows, a side canyon off the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. However, the precise location of the original "Kincaid's Cave" remains uncertain.

## Conclusion
The locations discussed in this report, including Quivira, Beechland, Nephi's Bountiful, Mount Sinai, and Kincaid's 'Cave', all have historical accounts and descriptions associated with them, but their exact identities and locations have not been conclusively verified through on-the-ground exploration and investigation. Further research and exploration may be needed to uncover the true nature and whereabouts of these enigmatic sites.
