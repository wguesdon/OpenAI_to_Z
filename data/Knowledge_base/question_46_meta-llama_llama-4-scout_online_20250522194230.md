# Community-Led Participatory Mapping and Story-Mapping in Archaeology
## Introduction
Community-led participatory mapping and story-mapping projects have emerged as innovative approaches in archaeological research, enabling the discovery of undocumented archaeological features while fostering collaboration between communities, researchers, and local stakeholders.

## The Power of Participatory Mapping
Participatory mapping involves engaging local communities in the mapping process, allowing them to share their knowledge, experiences, and perspectives on the landscape. This approach has proven effective in identifying previously unknown or undocumented archaeological sites.

### Case Studies

* In north-western Argentina, a participatory mapping project led to the discovery of the Cerro Quemado site, an administrative center of the Inka empire [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1794). Local students and teachers contributed to the mapping effort, which was complemented by drone technology and spatial photogrammetry.
* In Queensland, Australia, a community-led project focused on the Gummingurru Aboriginal stone arrangement site, which has undergone significant changes since European settlement. The project demonstrated the value of counter-mapping theory in documenting both tangible and intangible elements of the site [www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03122417.2018.1455289).
* In central California, researchers used historical maps to investigate Native American settlements during the mid-19th century. By combining cartographic and archaeological evidence, they were able to discover and interpret archaeological deposits [www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1416849).

## Story-Mapping and Community Engagement
Story-mapping projects involve collecting and mapping local stories, legends, and oral traditions associated with specific landscapes. This approach can provide valuable insights into the cultural and historical significance of archaeological sites.

* In Vanuatu, a historical archaeology project incorporated local perspectives through collaborative, community-based research. The project demonstrated the applicability of this approach to understanding mission landscapes and the importance of incorporating oral traditions [muse.jhu.edu](https://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/asian_perspectives/v053/53.1.flexner.html).

## Documenting Historic Sites
Participatory mapping and story-mapping projects can also contribute to the documentation and preservation of historic sites.

* In Arkansas, a project used modern mapping technology to document the Ida Bell Cemetery, a historic African American cemetery. The effort resulted in the mapping and photographing of over 125 grave locations [archeology.uark.edu](https://archeology.uark.edu/ida-bell-cemetery/).

## Conclusion
Community-led participatory mapping and story-mapping projects have proven effective in revealing undocumented archaeological features while promoting collaboration and community engagement. By combining local knowledge, oral traditions, and advanced technologies, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical significance of archaeological sites.
