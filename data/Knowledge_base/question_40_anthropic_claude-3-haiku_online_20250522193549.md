# Exploring Indigenous Knowledge of Ancient Earthworks and Structures

## Question
Which Indigenous groups maintain knowledge of ancient earthworks or structures?

## Summary

Based on the web search results, several Indigenous groups from various regions have maintained knowledge and connections to ancient earthworks, monuments, and other structures on their traditional lands:

1. **Gunditjmara People, Australia**: The Gunditjmara Traditional Owners have maintained their connection to Gunditjmara country and continue to progress their rights and interests in their cultural identity, social justice, native title, cultural heritage, and land justice for their traditional lands.

2. **Indigenous Australians**: Some Indigenous groups in Australia, such as the ones described in the "You Call It Desert: We Used to Live There" book, maintain knowledge of their desert environments, including features like "fairy circles" and "termite linyji" that have been the subject of scientific study.

3. **Indigenous Peoples in Canada**: The report "Indigenous Religion and Monuments of the Land" discusses ancient earthworks, rockworks, rings, and mounds found in Canada, though details on specific Indigenous groups maintaining this knowledge are limited in the provided information.

4. **Hopewell Culture, North America**: While not directly an Indigenous group, the Hopewell culture in the Ohio River valley is noted for constructing large, significant mounds and other earthworks, which were important ceremonial and social centers.

The information suggests that many Indigenous communities have long-standing connections and knowledge related to ancient structures and landscapes on their traditional territories, though the extent and specifics of this knowledge may have been impacted by colonial histories. Further research would be needed to better understand the diverse Indigenous groups and their ongoing relationships with these ancient sites and features.
