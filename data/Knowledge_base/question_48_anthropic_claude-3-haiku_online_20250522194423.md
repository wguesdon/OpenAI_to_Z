# Anthropogenic Soils and Long-Term Human Settlements in the Amazon

## Question
What soil types are most associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon?

## Summary
The research presented in the provided sources indicates that two main types of anthropogenic soils are associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon region:

1. **Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE)**: Also known as "terra preta", these are highly fertile, carbon-rich soils that were intentionally created by human activities, such as the addition of charcoal, bone, and other organic matter. ADEs are found in areas of long-term human habitation and are characterized by dark coloration, high nutrient levels, and the presence of ceramic shards.

2. **Terra Mulata**: These soils are lighter in color, less fertile, and lack the high concentration of pottery found in ADEs. They are thought to be the result of more subtle soil modification, such as the use of these areas for agriculture.

The research suggests that rather than two distinct soil types, there is a continuum of soil fertility and modification between the more intensively managed ADE core areas and the less intensively modified terra mulata soils. This reflects the overlapping and constantly changing boundaries of habitation and agricultural areas in the Amazon.

## Detailed Findings

1. **Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE)**: 
   - ADEs are characterized by dark coloration, high nutrient levels, and the presence of ceramic shards, indicating long-term human habitation and soil modification.
   - The creation of ADEs is believed to have involved the intentional addition of charcoal, bone, and other organic matter to the soil.
   - ADEs are found in areas with a history of occupation ranging from 5,000 to the present day, with most sites dating between 1,000 and 300 years ago.
   - ADEs are primarily located in the central and eastern Brazilian Amazon, with fewer sites near Andean settlements.

2. **Terra Mulata**:
   - Terra mulata soils are lighter in color, less fertile, and lack the high concentration of pottery found in ADEs.
   - These soils are thought to be the result of more subtle soil modification, such as the use of these areas for agriculture.
   - The origins of terra mulata soils remain enigmatic and contested, with research suggesting a continuum between the highly modified ADE core areas and the less intensively modified terra mulata soils.

3. **Soil Continuum**:
   - Rather than two distinct soil types, research suggests that ADE sites exhibit a gradient of soil fertility and modification, with a highly fertile core area grading into more subtly modified soils.
   - This reflects the overlapping and constantly changing boundaries of habitation and agricultural areas in the Amazon.

4. **Significance for Understanding Amazonian Crop Domestication**:
   - The formation of anthropogenic soils, such as ADEs, is linked to the domestication of key Amazonian crops like manioc (Manihot esculenta).
   - The distribution of sweet and bitter manioc varieties may be related to the widespread appearance of ADEs during the first millennium AD.

In summary, the research indicates that Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) and terra mulata soils are the main types of anthropogenic soils associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon, with a continuum of soil modification and fertility between these two categories.
