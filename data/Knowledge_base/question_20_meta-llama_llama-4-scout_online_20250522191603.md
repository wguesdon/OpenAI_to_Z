# The Scale of Pre-Columbian Settlements in the Amazon
## Introduction

The question of the size of the largest confirmed pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon is a topic of ongoing research and debate among archaeologists and anthropologists. Recent studies have shed new light on the complexity and scale of pre-Columbian societies in the Amazon region.

## The Size of Pre-Columbian Settlements

Research suggests that pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon were much larger and more complex than previously thought. For example, a study published in [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-cities-of-the-amazon/) describes the discovery of large, permanent settlements along the lower Negro and upper Xingu Rivers in the Brazilian Amazon. These settlements are believed to have been home to populations of up to 1,000 to 2,000 people, with extensive ditches and earthworks.

Similarly, a study published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7) found that pre-Columbian earth-builders settled along the entire southern rim of the Amazon, with a chain of Arawak-speaking populations sharing a common ethos of settled village life. The study suggests that these settlements were likely connected by a network of earthworks and trade routes.

## Large Settlements in the Amazon

Some of the largest confirmed pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon include:

* The Casarabe culture area, which spans approximately 4,500 kmÂ² and features large settlement sites with civic-ceremonial architecture, including stepped platforms, U-shaped structures, and conical pyramids [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04780-4).
* The settlements along the lower Negro and upper Xingu Rivers in the Brazilian Amazon, which are believed to have been home to populations of up to 1,000 to 2,000 people [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-cities-of-the-amazon/).
* The large settlement sites in the Bolivian Amazon, which feature ranked concentric polygonal banks and straight, raised causeways that connect to lower-ranked sites [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04780-4).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, recent research suggests that the largest confirmed pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon were much larger and more complex than previously thought, with populations of up to 1,000 to 2,000 people and extensive earthworks and infrastructure.
