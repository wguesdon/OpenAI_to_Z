# Indigenous Groups Maintaining Knowledge of Ancient Earthworks or Structures

## Question Restatement
**Which Indigenous groups maintain knowledge of ancient earthworks or structures?**

## Introduction
Indigenous groups around the world have maintained oral, cultural, and sometimes physical knowledge of ancient earthworks and structures, often passed down through generations despite colonization and displacement. These earthworks—including mounds, stone arrangements, rings, and other constructed forms—have spiritual, cultural, and historical significance. This report synthesizes current understandings of which Indigenous communities continue to hold knowledge related to these ancient monuments.

## Indigenous Groups with Knowledge of Ancient Earthworks or Structures

### 1. **The Gunditjmara People of Australia**
- The Gunditjmara people, traditional owners of areas in what is now Victoria, Australia, have strong connections to ancient stone arrangements and earthworks. These structures include elaborately constructed stone fish traps and other arrangements that are tens of thousands of years old.
- The Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation (GMTOAC) actively works to preserve their cultural heritage, including these ancient earthworks that affirm their identity and connection to country.
- Their knowledge is integral to land justice and cultural heritage preservation efforts today.

### 2. **Various Aboriginal Groups Across Australia**
- Many Aboriginal groups have associations with stone arrangements whose original purposes may be lost or only partially understood but remain culturally significant.
- The knowledge about these stone arrangements may have been transmitted orally or digitally recorded and is sometimes fragmentary due to colonial disruptions.
- Some stone arrangements in Australia are so old that their specific traditional meanings might have been forgotten even before colonial times.
- These arrangements are often referred to as sacred sites or linked to Dreamtime stories within Indigenous oral traditions.

### 3. **Indigenous Peoples of North America (Hopewell culture centers)**
- Indigenous groups in North America, specifically those linked to or descended from the Hopewell culture, maintain cultural memories and connections to massive mound-building societies.
- For example, the Manring archaeological site in Ohio is a significant Hopewell mound site.
- Some contemporary Indigenous nations maintain traditions related to these mounds and emphasize their importance for spiritual practices and ancestral connections.
- Artifacts such as obsidian spears, copper breastplates, and marine shell beads excavated at these sites point to wide-ranging networks and cultural complexities that Indigenous oral histories may help illuminate or support.

### 4. **Australian Aboriginal Songlines and Ancient Landscapes**
- Some Indigenous Australian groups possess knowledge embodied in “songlines,” which relate to long-sunken geographical features and ancient landscapes.
- These oral traditions map and describe connections to the earthworks and landscape features that exist or once existed.
- This knowledge system reflects a deep understanding of the environment and ancestral history encoded in songs and stories.
- Modern archaeological studies working with Indigenous communities use advanced mapping techniques to study these sites further.

## Summary
The Indigenous groups known to maintain knowledge of ancient earthworks or structures include:

- **Gunditjmara people** in Victoria, Australia, with their traditional stone arrangements and fish traps.
- Various **Australian Aboriginal peoples** connected to ancient stone arrangements, some of which may pre-date recorded history.
- Descendants of the **Hopewell culture** and other North American Indigenous groups with significant mound-building traditions.
- Aboriginal groups in Australia whose **songlines** encode knowledge of ancient landscapes and earthworks.

Preservation efforts and scientific collaborations emphasize the importance of Indigenous knowledge in understanding these ancient monuments' roles and meanings.
