# Dating Techniques Used to Establish Chronologies for Known Amazon Sites

**Question:**  
What dating techniques have been used to establish chronologies for known Amazon sites?

---

## Introduction

Understanding the chronology of archaeological and paleoenvironmental sites in the Amazon region relies heavily on accurate dating methods. Several scientific techniques have been employed to date artifacts, sediments, and organic remains, shedding light on the timing of human occupation, cultural development, and environmental changes in this vast tropical landscape.

## Key Dating Techniques Used in Amazon Sites

### 1. Radiocarbon Dating (Carbon-14 Dating)

- **Description:** Radiocarbon dating measures the decay of carbon-14 isotopes in organic materials, allowing age estimation of once-living materials up to about 50,000 years old.
- **Applications in Amazon:**  
  - Used extensively for dating charcoal from archaeological sites and shell middens, such as prehistoric shell middens near Santarém in the lower Amazon.  
  - Radiocarbon dates for charcoal and shell materials at these sites have yielded ages ranging from about 8,000 to 7,000 years before present, establishing some of the earliest pottery and settlements in the Western Hemisphere.  
- **Example:** Studies of shellmound sites at the margins of Guanabara Bay involved charcoal identification and radiocarbon dating to create a robust chronological framework for human activity and environmental proxies [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.254.5038.1621?cookieSet=1), [cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/radiocarbon/article/abs/amourins-shellmound-uncovering-biodiversity-and-chronology-through-charcoal-analyses/7FDA6B747BB2B5FB0F1D6E52BE85925C).

### 2. Thermoluminescence (TL) Dating

- **Description:** TL dating measures the accumulated radiation dose in crystalline materials (commonly pottery) since they were last heated.
- **Applications in Amazon:**  
  - Used for dating pottery fragments from archaeological contexts, such as those found at the Hatahara archaeological site in the Amazon Valley.  
  - This technique helps confirm occupation periods consistent with other archaeological estimates.  
- **Example:** Pottery from the Amazon Valley has been subjected to TL dating alongside other techniques to refine site chronology [sciencedirect.com (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

### 3. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) Dating

- **Description:** OSL dating determines the last time mineral grains (usually quartz or feldspar) were exposed to sunlight or heat.
- **Applications in Amazon:**  
  - Used for dating sediments related to archaeological deposits and river evolution, such as those along the Negro and Solimões rivers.  
  - Also used on pottery shards in tandem with TL to confirm archaeological timelines.  
- **Example:** OSL has enhanced understanding of sediment deposition and human occupation in Amazonian river valleys [sciencedirect.com (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969806X12005397), [sciencedirect.com (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

### 4. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Dating

- **Description:** EPR dating measures trapped electrons in mineral lattices, providing age estimates for materials like tooth enamel and pottery.
- **Applications in Amazon:**  
  - Employed alongside TL and OSL for ceramics to provide complementary dating results.  
- **Example:** Pottery fragments from the Amazon Valley have been dated using EPR to refine chronological understanding of cultural deposits [sciencedirect.com (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003078).

## Summary of Techniques and Their Roles

| Technique                | Materials Dated               | Chronological Range                 | Notable Amazon Sites / Finds                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Radiocarbon Dating (C-14) | Charcoal, shell, organic remains | Up to ~50,000 years BP            | Prehistoric shell middens near Santarém; Amourins shellmound |
| Thermoluminescence (TL)   | Pottery, ceramics             | Up to several hundred thousand years | Hatahara archaeological site pottery            |
| Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) | Sediments, pottery grains | Up to ~200,000 years or more      | Sediments from Negro and Solimões rivers, Hatahara site pottery |
| Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) | Pottery, tooth enamel       | Variable, overlapping with TL and OSL | Pottery from archaeological sites in Amazon Valley |

## Conclusion

Chronologies for known Amazon sites have been established predominantly through a combination of:

- **Radiocarbon dating** for organic materials indicating human occupation.
- **Thermoluminescence and OSL** for directly dating pottery and sediments associated with settlements.
- **EPR** as a complementary method to TL and OSL for ceramics.

These multi-method approaches provide robust and cross-validated age frameworks that reveal human presence and environmental history in Amazonia going back at least 8,000 years, with some evidence suggesting continuous occupation and cultural complexity during the early to middle Holocene.
