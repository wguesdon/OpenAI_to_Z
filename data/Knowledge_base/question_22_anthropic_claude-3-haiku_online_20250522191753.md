# Uncovering the Archaeological Potential of the Brazilian Amazon

## Question
What are the locations of suspected archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest from the literature that have not yet been confirmed?

## Summary
The literature reviewed provides evidence of the potential for a broader geographic distribution of pre-Columbian archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon than previously documented. Several key findings include:

1. **Expansion of Inland Settlement**: LiDAR data reveals a pattern of non-randomly distributed depressions in the Tapajós National Forest, suggesting the expansion of inland settlement farther south than previously established through conventional archaeological fieldwork.

2. **Extensive Occupation of Southern Amazonia**: Pre-Columbian ditched enclosures discovered in the Tapajós headwaters indicate an 1800 km stretch of southern Amazonia was occupied by earth-building cultures around AD 1250-1500. Modeling suggests these sites could be found over an area of ~400,000 km2.

3. **Underreporting of Archaeological Sites**: The documentation of hundreds of previously unreported archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon challenges the notion of sparse early human occupation in the outer Amazon basin, indicating many more sites likely remain to be discovered.

4. **Large, Permanent Amazonian Settlements**: Archaeological evidence from the lower Negro and upper Xingu rivers in Brazil shows the existence of large (30-50 ha), permanent Amerindian settlements, casting doubt on the view that environmental limitations prevented sedentism and demographic growth in the region.

While the exact locations of suspected but unconfirmed sites are not provided, the literature suggests a broader geographic distribution of pre-Columbian archaeological sites across southern and western Amazonia than previously recognized. Further exploration, particularly using remote sensing techniques like LiDAR, is needed to uncover the full extent of human settlement in the Brazilian Amazon.
