# Open-Access LIDAR Datasets Covering Portions of the Brazilian Amazon

## Question Restatement

**What open-access LIDAR datasets cover portions of the Brazilian Amazon?**

---

## Overview

Several open-access LIDAR datasets provide detailed information on forest structure, biomass, canopy gaps, and selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon region. These datasets aid in forest inventory, biomass estimation, monitoring selective logging, and understanding tree mortality and canopy dynamics.

## Key Open-Access LIDAR Datasets for Brazilian Amazon

### 1. EBA Project LIDAR Dataset (2016 Airborne LIDAR Flights)

- **Description:** This dataset consists of airborne LIDAR flight lines covering the Brazilian Amazon region as part of the Improving Biomass Estimation Methods for the Amazon (EBA) project by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE).
- **Coverage:** 610 non-overlapping flight lines each measuring 300 m by 12.5 km.
- **Purpose:** Designed to analyze canopy gaps, tree mortality, and forest dynamics at a large scale across the Amazon.
- **Links:**  
  - Nature article with dataset description: [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80809-w)  
  - This dataset provides an opportunity to study storm and lightning mortality impacts by analyzing LIDAR gap dynamics.

### 2. Forest Inventory and Biophysical Measurements Dataset (2009-2018)

- **Description:** Contains measurements of tree diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, species identification, crown radius, decomposition status for dead trees, and aboveground biomass estimates.
- **Format:** Available in CSV and shapefile formats with detailed sampling methodologies.
- **Coverage:** Includes multiple plots across portions of the Brazilian Amazon, providing ground-truth data linked with remote sensing products such as LIDAR.

### 3. Selective Logging Monitoring LIDAR Dataset in Western Amazonia

- **Description:** Repeat LIDAR flights used to monitor selective logging impacts on forest canopy structure and biomass in western Amazonia.
- **Details:** Includes measurement of canopy height changes, area impacted by logging, and aboveground biomass changes between consecutive years (2010 and 2011).
- **Area:** Focused on the state forests near Acre, Brazil.

### 4. Biomass Estimation and Low-Intensity Logging Dataset - Antimary State Forest (Acre State)

- **Description:** Airborne scanning LIDAR data alongside ground plots used to estimate aboveground biomass and identify low-intensity selective logging areas.
- **Data Use:** Modeling biomass and disturbance based on LIDAR metrics such as canopy height quartiles and variance.
- **Region:** Antimary State Forest, Acre State, Brazilian Amazon.

### 5. Wetland Extent and Vegetation Type Maps

- Although primarily focused on wetland extent and vegetation rather than LIDAR specifically, this dataset may complement LIDAR data for regional ecological understanding.
- **Source:** Global Rainforest Mapping Project (GRFM) satellite image mosaics from the mid-1990s, covering lowland Amazon basin.

## Conclusion

There are several open-access LIDAR datasets and related forest inventory datasets that cover the Brazilian Amazon, with data ranging from detailed tree metrics and biomass estimation to large-scale canopy gap dynamics and logging impact monitoring. These datasets are valuable for researchers monitoring forest health, biomass carbon stocks, and environmental changes in Amazonian forests.
