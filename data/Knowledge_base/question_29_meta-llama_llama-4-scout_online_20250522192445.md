# The Mysterious "Z" of Percy Fawcett
## Introduction
The question at hand is to provide details about "Z" as recorded by Percy Fawcett in his journals and correspondence.

## Background
Percy Fawcett was a British explorer who disappeared in 1925 while searching for a lost city in the Amazon jungle, which he called "Z". His expeditions and the mystery surrounding his disappearance have captivated the imagination of many.

## Details about "Z"
According to [jasoncolavito.com](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/percy-fawcett-victim-of-a-theosophical-obsession), Fawcett's obsession with finding "Z" was influenced by Theosophical ideas. 

Fawcett described "Z" as a city with arches and domes, statues, and mysterious hieroglyphic engravings. He believed "Z" to be the capital of a vast civilization, of which the city described in Manuscript 512 was a mere outpost.

## The Search for "Z"
Fawcett's search for "Z" was documented in his correspondence and journals. His 1925 expedition, which included his son Jack and friend Henry Costin, aimed to find "Z" but ended in their disappearance.

## Archival Records
Some of Fawcett's correspondence and journals are archived at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries. The archives include [Fawcett's 1925 correspondence](https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/agsny/id/13829/), which may provide more insights into his search for "Z".

## Plausible Explanations
Some researchers have proposed plausible explanations for the location of "Z". For example, [jasoncolavito.com](https://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/a-plausible-explanation-for-the-lost-city-of-manuscript-512) mentions a theory that "Z" could be located in an area known as Gentio do Ouro, adjacent to Xique-Xique in the state of Bahia, Brazil.

## Conclusion
While the exact details of "Z" remain a mystery, Fawcett's journals and correspondence provide valuable insights into his search for the lost city.
