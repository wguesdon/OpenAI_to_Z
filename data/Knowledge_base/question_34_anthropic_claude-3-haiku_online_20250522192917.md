- Brief mention of "missions of the principal islands in the archipelago", suggesting some discussion of geography and transportation between islands.

However, the search results do not contain any explicit references to large-scale earthworks, causeways, or engineered canal systems constructed by the Jesuits or other missionaries. The focus appears to be more on river-based transportation and navigation rather than major infrastructure projects.
