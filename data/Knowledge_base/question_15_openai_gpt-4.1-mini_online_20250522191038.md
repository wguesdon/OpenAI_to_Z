# National and State-Level Open-Data Portals Providing Ancillary Layers for Site Prediction

**Question:**  
*What national or state-level open-data portals provide ancillary layers (hydrology, soils, roads, deforestation) that could help in site prediction?*

---

## Introduction

Ancillary geospatial data layers such as hydrology, soils, roads, and deforestation are essential for various site prediction and environmental analysis applications. These layers contribute to understanding landscape characteristics, accessibility, environmental constraints, and land-use changes. Several national and state open-data portals aggregate such datasets, making them accessible for analysis.

## National-Level Open Data Portals

### 1. GeoPlatform.gov  
- **Description:** The GeoPlatform is a federal government initiative dedicated to making geospatial data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and available for use in federal, state, and local governments and the public. It provides various ancillary geospatial layers that include hydrology, soils, roads, and environmental change datasets such as deforestation rates.  
- **Features:**  
  - GeoPlatform FAIR Principles guide data openness and reuse.  
  - GeoPlatform STAC and API provide programmatic access to detailed geospatial data.  
  - Data covers nationwide scope, incorporating multiple federal sources.  
- **Usefulness for Site Prediction:** Its broad dataset coverage and compliance with FAIR principles make it a key resource for integrated site prediction projects requiring multiple ancillary layers.  
- **Website:** [geoplatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/)

### 2. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Geospatial Business Platform Hub  
- **Description:** The BLM Geospatial Business Platform Hub is a centralized portal providing access to BLM's landscape and location geospatial data. It includes layers such as hydrology, land use, roads, and environmental factors which are crucial for land management and site assessment.  
- **Features:**  
  - Searchable by keywords or geographic location.  
  - National and state-level data coverage.  
  - Visualizations accompany datasets for better understanding.  
- **Website:** [blm.gov/services/geospatial/GISData](https://www.blm.gov/services/geospatial/GISData)

## State-Level Open Data Portals

### 1. California State Geoportal  
- **Description:** California’s official geoportal provides comprehensive geospatial data sets including hydrology, soils, transportation networks (roads), and environmental data useful for understanding deforestation and land cover changes.  
- **Features:**  
  - Supports OGC Records API for standard metadata discovery.  
  - Detailed state-oriented datasets and thematic collections.  
- **Website:** [gis.data.ca.gov](https://gis.data.ca.gov/)

### 2. Washington State Geospatial Open Data Portal  
- **Description:** Washington’s portal delivers access to extensive geospatial data, including hydrologic features, soil types, roads, and forest cover data which can help monitor deforestation and land use dynamics in the state.  
- **Features:**  
  - RSS and DCAT feeds allow monitoring of catalog updates.  
  - OGC Records API facilitates standardized metadata search.  
- **Website:** [geo.wa.gov](https://geo.wa.gov/)

### 3. State of Alaska Geoportal  
- **Description:** This is a cooperative project bringing together data from multiple local, state, and federal sources in Alaska. It provides access to thematic maps and apps for hydrology, soils, roads, and forest management, including data relevant to deforestation and environmental changes in Alaska.  
- **Features:**  
  - Popular maps and apps highlight key environmental themes.  
  - Data hosted by public agencies with coordinated contributions.  
- **Website:** [gis.data.alaska.gov](https://gis.data.alaska.gov/)

## Conclusion

For practitioners seeking ancillary layers such as hydrology, soils, roads, and deforestation for site prediction, several robust national and state-level geospatial portals are available. The **GeoPlatform.gov** serves as the primary national repository encompassing multi-theme geospatial data adhering to FAIR principles. At the state level, portals such as **California State Geoportal**, **Washington State Geospatial Portal**, and the **Alaska Geoportal** provide rich localized data resources and services that support detailed environmental and site analysis.

These portals also adopt standard interoperable APIs (like OGC Records API) and feeds (RSS, DCAT) facilitating seamless data integration and updates, which is critical for ongoing site prediction tasks.
