## Spatial Relationship between Sacred Groves and Archaeological Mound Fields

### Question

What is the spatial relationship between sacred-grove distributions (identified through ethnobotanical surveys) and archaeological mound fields?

### Introduction

The relationship between sacred landscapes and archaeological features, such as mound fields, is an important topic in understanding the cultural and environmental dynamics of past societies. Ethnobotanical surveys can provide insights into the distribution and significance of sacred groves, while archaeological investigations of mound fields can shed light on the spatial organization and ritual practices of ancient communities.

### Findings from the Literature

The web search results provide relevant information on the spatial aspects of mound fields and sacred landscapes in different regions:

[cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/moieties-and-mortuary-mounds-dualism-at-a-mound-and-enclosure-complex-in-the-southern-brazilian-highlands/3493444F451F310408A4E3C4CF2805FD) - This study examines a mound and enclosure complex in the southern Brazilian highlands, where the spatial organization of the mortuary features reflects a dual social structure, with paired mounds and enclosures. The authors suggest that this spatial dualism is linked to the moiety system observed in modern southern Jê groups.

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416512000554) - This article discusses the sacred landscapes of the southern Brazilian highlands, focusing on the mound and enclosure complexes of the southern proto-Jê people. The findings indicate historical continuity in the organization of space, with a clear spatial division between low and high places, as well as circular/concentric layouts.

The results suggest that the configuration of the plantscapes (landscapes of dwelling) was influenced by socio-environmental choices and constraints.

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21001604) - This article investigates the spatial structure of an earth-mound field in the Brazilian Savanna, using spectral and morphometric data analysis. The results indicate an ordered distribution of the mounds, suggesting a planned or organized landscape.

While these studies do not directly address the relationship between sacred groves and mound fields, they provide valuable insights into the spatial organization and potential social and environmental significance of mound features in different cultural contexts.

### Conclusion

The available literature suggests that the spatial distribution and organization of archaeological mound features can be closely linked to the cultural and ritual practices of past societies. The studies highlight the importance of considering the spatial dimension, including the relationship between high and low places, circular/concentric layouts, and the potential links to dual social structures and moiety systems. Further research combining ethnobotanical surveys and archaeological investigations would be valuable to understand the connections between sacred landscapes and the spatial patterning of mound fields.
