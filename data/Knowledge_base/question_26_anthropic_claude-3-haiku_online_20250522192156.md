# Indigenous Ancestral Sites: Uncovering the Uncharted History

## The Question

Where have Indigenous communities reported ancestral sites that archaeologists haven't formally documented?

## Summary of Findings

The web search results provide several examples of Indigenous communities reporting the discovery of ancestral sites that had not been formally documented by archaeologists:

1. **Wet'suwet'en Territory, British Columbia**: Artifacts, including stone tools, were discovered by camp volunteers on the Coastal GasLink pipeline worksite in February 2019. These artifacts are estimated to be from the Shuswap Horizon (3500–2400 BP) and are closely tied to Wet'suwet'en identity and cultural heritage. However, the initial archaeological assessment by Coastal GasLink was done remotely without any on-site investigation.

2. **Papaschase First Nation, Edmonton, Alberta**: The Papaschase First Nation believes it has located a potential burial site on private property in Edmonton. The nation is seeking access to the site to conduct further investigation, as any development on the property would require an archaeological assessment.

3. **Sumas First Nation, Abbotsford, British Columbia**: Archeologists discovered over 40 earthen mounds believed to be burial mounds on a property in Abbotsford. This site also contained a "transformer" rock and culturally modified trees, all of which were important spiritual sites to the Sumas First Nation. This discovery halted a $40 million development plan. [cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/aboriginal-gravesites-halt-40m-development-plan-in-abbotsford-1.2852924)

These examples demonstrate that Indigenous communities often have deep knowledge of their ancestral sites and landscapes, which may not have been formally documented by archaeologists. Meaningful engagement and collaboration with Indigenous communities is crucial to uncover the full history and cultural significance of these sites.
