# Investigating the Relationship between Modern Indigenous Reserve Boundaries and Historical Occupation Cores Inferred from Ceramic-Style Catchments

## Question

How do modern Indigenous reserve boundaries correspond to historical occupation cores inferred from ceramic-style catchments?

## Introduction

Ceramic analysis has long been used as a tool for understanding past human settlement patterns and resource use. The Ceramic Resource Area Model (CRAM) is one approach that has been applied to link the mineral and chemical composition of ceramics to the areas where raw materials were procured and pottery was manufactured. This information can then be used to infer patterns of interaction and exchange between communities.

However, the CRAM model has some limitations, as it is based on ethnographic data that may not fully capture the complexity of past mobility and resource use strategies. Additionally, the correspondence between modern Indigenous reserve boundaries and the historical occupation cores inferred from ceramic data has not been extensively explored.

- The CRAM provides a means to link "resources areas" used by potters and the mineral and chemical composition of ceramics to infer areas of manufacture and patterns of interaction and exchange.
- However, the CRAM model has three interrelated problems: 1) it assumes energy costs to travel are cross-culturally similar, 2) it is based on mobility using only foot transport, not modern transportation, and 3) it does not fully capture the complexity of past mobility and resource use strategies.

- This study assesses the evidence for continuity among the Coast Salish people at different social-spatial scales using radiocarbon dating, defining continuity as the ability to pass on place-based knowledge inter-generationally.
- The authors utilize demographic modeling of the radiocarbon dates to evaluate whether there are significant gaps in the data that would indicate discontinuities in occupation.

- This study combines geo-archaeological evidence with Haíɫzaqv oral history to investigate long-term human investment and resource use at an archaeological site on Triquet Island, British Columbia, Canada.
- The site is located within the N̓úláw̓itxˇv Tribal Area, which highlights the importance of incorporating Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in archaeological research.

- This study analyzes the chemical composition of pottery sherds from Late Developmental period sites in the Tewa Basin, New Mexico, revealing local and non-local ceramic production areas.
- The presence of non-local Cibola white ware ceramic types at these sites has been interpreted as evidence of cultural interaction or immigration from communities associated with the Chaco regional system.

## Discussion

The web search results provide insights into the use of ceramic analysis to understand past human settlement patterns and resource use, as well as the limitations of the CRAM model. While the CRAM can be a valuable tool for linking ceramic composition to resource areas, it does not fully capture the complexity of past mobility and resource use strategies.

The studies on continuity among the Coast Salish people and the integration of geo-archaeological evidence with Indigenous knowledge demonstrate the importance of incorporating multiple lines of evidence and perspectives in archaeological research. This holistic approach can provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between modern Indigenous reserve boundaries and the historical occupation cores inferred from ceramic data.

Additionally, the study on indigenous pottery from Sonora, Mexico and the analysis of ceramic composition in the Tewa Basin, New Mexico highlight the potential for applying similar methods in other regions to investigate spatial distribution and cultural interaction.

## Conclusion

The correspondence between modern Indigenous reserve boundaries and the historical occupation cores inferred from ceramic-style catchments is a complex and nuanced issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. While ceramic analysis can provide valuable insights, it needs to be contextualized within a broader understanding of past mobility, resource use, and cultural continuity. Incorporating Indigenous knowledge and perspectives, as well as multiple lines of evidence, can help to develop a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships.
