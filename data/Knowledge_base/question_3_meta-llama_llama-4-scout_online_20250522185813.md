# Machine Learning Models for Identifying Archaeological Features under Forest Canopy
=====================================================================================

## Introduction

The use of machine learning models in archaeology has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the detection of archaeological features under forest canopy. This report aims to provide an overview of the machine learning models that have successfully identified archaeological features beneath forest canopy.

## Restatement of the Question

What machine learning models have successfully identified archaeological features beneath forest canopy?

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models have been employed to identify archaeological features under forest canopy. Some of the notable models include:

### 1. Modified Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN)

*   A modified Mask R-CNN approach has been used to detect archaeological sites on high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital elevation models in the North German Lowland [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1806).
*   This approach combines image augmentation, image preprocessing steps, and the deep learning-based adaptive gradient method with a dynamic bound on the learning rate (AdaBound) optimization technique.
*   The model achieved an average recall of 83% and an average precision of 87% in identifying archaeological sites.

## LiDAR-Based Approaches

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been widely used for archaeological prospection, particularly in forested areas. Some notable LiDAR-based approaches include:

### 1. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)

*   ALS has been demonstrated as an important tool for systematic archaeological prospection in vegetated areas [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307001252).
*   However, there are some restrictions to consider when using ALS data.

### 2. Full-Waveform Airborne Laser Scanning

*   Full-waveform airborne laser scanning has been used for archaeological prospection in forested areas [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307001252).

## Case Studies

Several case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models and LiDAR-based approaches in identifying archaeological features under forest canopy. Some notable examples include:

### 1. El Viandar Castle (Husum) in El Hoyo (Belmez-Córdoba, Spain)

*   A study used LiDAR mapping surveys to gather data and analyzed other open-access remote sensing resources to detect an ancient fortress (El Viandar Castle) and its surrounding settlement under Mediterranean forest canopy [mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/3/72).

### 2. Krycklan Catchment in Northern Sweden

*   A study compared the performance of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) ALS data in detecting cultural remains in the Krycklan catchment in northern Sweden [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2019.1677424).
*   The study found that HR data detected about three times as many cultural remains as LR data.

## Conclusion

Machine learning models, particularly modified Mask R-CNN, and LiDAR-based approaches have shown promising results in identifying archaeological features under forest canopy. These approaches have been successfully applied in various case studies, demonstrating their potential for archaeological prospection in forested areas.
