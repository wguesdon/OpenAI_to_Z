# Locations of Known Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Rainforest

## The Question

What are the locations of known archaeological sites in the Amazon Rainforest (give coordinates so I can locate them on a map)?

## Web Search Results

The web search results provide information on several archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest, including:

1. [latitude.to](https://latitude.to/articles-by-country/pe/peru/148075/paratoari): The Paratoari site in Peru, also known as the Pyramids of Paratoari or Pantiacolla, is located at coordinates:
   - Latitude: -12.6706°
   - Longitude: -71.4567°

2. [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01067-7.pdf): The article discusses the geolocation of unpublished archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon, but does not provide specific coordinates.

3. [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7): The article mentions pre-Columbian earth-building sites along the southern rim of the Amazon, but does not provide exact coordinates.

4. [Science.org](https://www.science.org/content/article/laser-mapping-reveals-hidden-structures-in-amazon-hints-thousands-more): The article discusses the use of laser mapping to reveal hidden structures in the Amazon, suggesting there may be thousands of additional unidentified archaeological sites in the region.

5. [PeerJ.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/): The article predicts the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites using machine learning, but does not provide specific coordinate locations.

## Summary

The web search results provide some information on the locations of known archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest, but the coordinates are only explicitly given for the Paratoari site in Peru. The other sources suggest there are many more unidentified archaeological sites in the Amazon, but do not provide their exact locations. More comprehensive field research and mapping efforts would be needed to obtain a more complete picture of the locations of archaeological sites in this vast and understudied region.
