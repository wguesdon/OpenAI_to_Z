# Indigenous Knowledge of Ancient Earthworks and Structures
The question of which Indigenous groups maintain knowledge of ancient earthworks or structures is a complex one, with various groups around the world possessing such knowledge.

## Introduction
Indigenous groups have a rich cultural heritage and a deep understanding of their ancestral lands, including the ancient earthworks and structures that dot the landscapes. These groups have maintained their knowledge and traditions despite colonization, forced assimilation, and the erosion of their lands.

## Groups with Knowledge of Ancient Earthworks and Structures

### In Canada
In Canada, the Indigenous group known as the Haudenosaunee, also referred to as the Iroquois, have a rich tradition of earthwork construction. Their ancestral lands are home to numerous earthworks, including the [Manring archaeological site](https://www.academia.edu/121005877/Indigenous_Religion_and_Monuments_of_the_Land_Ancient_Earthworks_Rockworks_Rings_and_Mounds_in_Canada), a Hopewell center located in Clark County, Ohio.

### In Australia
In Australia, the Indigenous group known as the Anangu people have a deep understanding of the ancient songlines that crisscross the continent. Recent studies have revealed that these songlines match the long-sunken landscape off Australia's coast [scientificamerican.com](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ancient-indigenous-songlines-match-long-sunken-landscape-off-australia1/).

### In Australia (continued)
The Yolngu people of North East Arnhem Land also possess knowledge of ancient structures, including termite mounds and "fairy circles." Research has shown that these features are linked, and the Yolngu people's traditional knowledge has contributed significantly to our understanding of these natural and cultural wonders [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-01994-1.pdf?error=cookies_not_supported&code=6f72efa9-475a-4f06-9d2e-d409ac19fee0).

### In Australia (continued)
In the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Indigenous group known as the Kaiadilt people have a rich tradition of stone-walled fish traps. These ancient structures are an important part of their cultural heritage, and efforts are being made to preserve and protect them [abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-12/fight-to-save-ancient-indigenous-fish-traps/11396302).

### In Victoria, Australia
In Victoria, Australia, the Indigenous group known as the Traditional Owners have a deep understanding of Aboriginal stone arrangements. These stone arrangements are an important part of their cultural heritage, but their purpose and significance have been lost over time [firstpeoplesrelations.vic.gov.au](https://www.firstpeoplesrelations.vic.gov.au/fact-sheet-aboriginal-stone-arrangements).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, various Indigenous groups around the world maintain knowledge of ancient earthworks and structures. These groups include the Haudenosaunee in Canada, the Anangu and Yolngu people in Australia, the Kaiadilt people in the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the Traditional Owners in Victoria, Australia. Their knowledge and traditions are an important part of their cultural heritage and contribute significantly to our understanding of the ancient world.
