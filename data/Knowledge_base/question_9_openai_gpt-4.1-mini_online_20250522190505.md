# Accessing Free High-Resolution Satellite Imagery of the Amazon Region

**Question:**  
*Where can we access free high-resolution satellite imagery of the Amazon region?*

---

## Introduction

Satellite imagery is a crucial tool for monitoring environmental changes such as deforestation, particularly in sensitive and vast areas like the Amazon rainforest. Access to free high-resolution satellite data enables researchers, governments, and conservationists to track changes effectively without the high costs traditionally associated with satellite imagery.

## Sources for Free High-Resolution Satellite Imagery

Several platforms offer **free satellite imagery**, including some with high enough resolution suitable for tracking changes in the Amazon region. Below are notable sources:

### 1. **NASA Earth Observing Systems**

- **Platform:** Earth Observatory by NASA  
- **Details:** NASA provides access to a variety of satellite imagery, including those used for tracking deforestation in the Amazon. While some sensors like MODIS have moderate resolution and may only detect large clearings (25 hectares or more), NASA's archive includes higher resolution data from other satellites.  
- **Use Case:** Ideal for tracking large-scale deforestation events and atmospheric changes; images come with scientific context and are publicly available.  
- **Access:** [NASA Earth Observatory - Amazon Deforestation collection](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/collection/1676/amazon-deforestation)  
- **Note:** Real-time images are generally not available, but regular updates support ongoing monitoring efforts.

### 2. **Collect Earth Online (CEO)**

- **Platform:** Collect Earth Online  
- **Details:** CEO is a free, user-friendly tool that integrates various satellite imagery data sources, allowing collaborative data collection and analysis without specialized software installation. It helps overcome traditional barriers by providing access to satellite data online.  
- **Use Case:** Suitable for countries and organizations wanting to monitor land use and deforestation comprehensively with contributed or existing data.  
- **Access:** [Collect Earth Online](https://www.collect.earth/)

### 3. **SkyWatch - Free Satellite Data Sources**

- **Platform:** SkyWatch provides a curated list of free satellite data providers, focusing on open data with various resolutions depending on the satellite.  
- **Details:** This guide helps users find platforms offering the highest resolution available for free and provides information about data accessibility (browsers or downloads).  
- **Access:** [Top 10 Free Sources of Satellite Data - SkyWatch](https://skywatch.com/free-sources-of-satellite-data/)  
- **Note:** It clarifies that truly real-time imagery with very high resolution (e.g., real-time images of a private house) is generally not available.

## Additional Notes

- **Image Licensing:** Be aware of image use and redistribution licenses. Some imagery may have specific restrictions requiring proper attribution or limitations on republishing. For example, platforms such as the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) advise checking these terms carefully.  
- **Resolution Limits:** While many sources offer free imagery, the highest-resolution images (sub-meter scale) may be limited or require purchase. However, medium resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2 with 10-20 meter resolution) is freely accessible and often sufficient for monitoring large-scale changes in the Amazon.

## Summary

To access free, high-resolution satellite imagery of the Amazon region, consider:

- NASAâ€™s Earth Observatory collections for scientifically curated images.  
- Collect Earth Online for collaborative and accessible data collection tools.  
- Resources like SkyWatch for identifying and navigating various free satellite data providers.

These platforms collectively offer robust access to satellite images that enable monitoring the Amazon rainforest's health and deforestation trends.
