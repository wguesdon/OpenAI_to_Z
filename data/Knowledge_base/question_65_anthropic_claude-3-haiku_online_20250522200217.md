# Determining Optimal Terrace Characteristics Using Machine Learning

## Question

Which combinations of slope (°), elevation (m), and flood-return interval best discriminate occupied vs. unused terraces?

## Introduction

Agricultural terraces are an important feature of many landscapes, providing a means of cultivating crops on steep slopes. Understanding the factors that influence the occupation and abandonment of terraces is crucial for preserving this valuable cultural heritage. In this report, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to identify the optimal combination of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval that can distinguish between occupied and unused terraces.

## Methodology

The analysis was based on the web search results provided, which included several studies that utilized machine learning methods for mapping and analyzing agricultural terraces.

[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/14/5/962) - This study used machine learning to detect agricultural terraces in southeast France, highlighting the importance of considering local geomorphological and data-quality factors to improve model performance.

[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622812001646) - The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of Maxent modeling in assessing environmental constraints and terrace locations, providing a method that can be used to study human-environment interactions.

[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/5/1021/pdf) - This study evaluated three different machine learning methods for object-based artificial terrace mapping in the Loess Plateau of China, highlighting the need for maintenance to detect terrace ridges.

[link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12518-018-0205-7.pdf) - The researchers discussed the integration of GIS tools to support terrace mapping, emphasizing the importance of using regional-scale maps and a checking system to examine representative sample basins.

[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/1/28/pdf) - This study assessed the sensitivity of spatial resolution differences in digital elevation models (DEMs) for estimating soil erosion rates and topographic factors on agricultural terraces in Nepal.

Based on these findings, we propose to use a combination of machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, to determine the optimal thresholds of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval that can best discriminate between occupied and unused terraces. This will involve:

1. Compiling a dataset of known occupied and unused terraces, along with their associated slope, elevation, and flood-return interval values.
2. Training and testing various machine learning models to identify the most predictive combination of these variables.
3. Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Interpreting the results to determine the optimal thresholds for each variable in distinguishing occupied from unused terraces.

## Results and Discussion

The results of the machine learning analysis will provide insights into the environmental factors that influence the occupation and abandonment of agricultural terraces. By identifying the optimal combination of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval, we can better understand the physical constraints and risks that shape the long-term sustainability of this important landscape feature.

The findings from this study can inform conservation and management strategies for agricultural terraces, helping to prioritize areas for preservation and guide the implementation of restoration efforts. Additionally, the methodology can be applied to other regions to study the human-environment interactions that have shaped the development and abandonment of terraced landscapes over time.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to uncover the underlying environmental factors that contribute to the occupation and abandonment of agricultural terraces. By analyzing the optimal thresholds of slope, elevation, and flood-return interval, we can gain valuable insights into the physical constraints and risks that shape the long-term sustainability of this important cultural heritage. The results of this analysis can inform conservation and management strategies to preserve and restore terraced landscapes for the benefit of local communities and future generations.
