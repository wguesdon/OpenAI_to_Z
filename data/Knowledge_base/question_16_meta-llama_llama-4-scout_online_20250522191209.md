# Locations of Known Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Rainforest
The Amazon Rainforest, spanning across nine countries in South America, is home to numerous archaeological sites that provide valuable insights into the lives of ancient civilizations. Here, we will discuss some of the known locations of these sites, including their coordinates.

## Paratoari, Peru
One notable site is Paratoari, also known as the Pyramids of Paratoari, Pyramids of Pantiacolla, or "The Dots". It is located in the Manu area of dense tropical rainforest in southeast Peru.

* Latitude: -12.6706° S or 12° 40' 14.02" S
* Longitude: -71.4567° W or 71° 27' 24.19" W

## Fonte Boa, Amazon
Another site is Fonte Boa, which features a mounded ring village with radiating roads built next to an earlier geometric enclosure.

## Predicted Sites
Recent studies have used laser mapping and machine learning to predict the locations of thousands of hidden structures in the Amazon. According to [science.org](https://www.science.org/content/article/laser-mapping-reveals-hidden-structures-in-amazon-hints-thousands-more), most of these unknown earthworks are concentrated in the southwest of the Amazon Basin.

## Geographic Distribution of Ancient Sites
A study published on [peerj.com](https://peerj.com/articles/15137/) used multi-class classification models to predict the geographic distribution of ancient Amazonian archaeological sites. The results show that the geographic distributions of earthworks, anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs), and other archaeological sites are mostly distinct.

## Harvard University's Geoglyph Project
The [Geoglyph Project](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/geoglyph/overview) at Harvard University is working to understand the extent of indigenous modifications to the Amazon rainforest. Their research suggests that indigenous populations increased biodiversity and soil quality in the regions they inhabited, producing terras pretas or anthropogenic dark earths (ADEs).

## Conclusion
These are just a few examples of the many archaeological sites in the Amazon Rainforest. Further research and exploration are needed to uncover the secrets of these ancient civilizations.
