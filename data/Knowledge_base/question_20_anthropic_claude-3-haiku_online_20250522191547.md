## Pre-Columbian Settlements in the Amazon

### Question
How large were the largest confirmed pre-Columbian settlements in the Amazon?

### Summary
Recent archaeological investigations in the Brazilian Amazon have provided evidence of large, permanent settlements that were likely associated with fairly dense regional populations. These findings challenge the view that environmental limitations prevented sedentism and demographic growth among Amazonian populations. The key findings from the research are:

1. **Large Settlements**: Preliminary regional surveys and in-depth studies of selected sites have identified large settlements ranging from 30-50 hectares (ha) in size.

2. **Permanence**: The associations between structural features, anthropogenically altered soils, and artifact distributions suggest that these were fully sedentary and relatively large populations, not temporary or seasonal settlements.

3. **Diversity of Settings**: These large, permanent settlements emerged in a variety of Amazonian settings, not necessarily correlated with the distribution of specific ecological variables like high fertility soils.

4. **Widespread Occurrence**: The distribution of these large settlements appears to have been widespread, with a belt of Arawak and other groups along the southern rim of the Amazon (SRA) spanning approximately 1,800 km east-west.

5. **Urbanization**: In the Bolivian Amazon, the Casarabe culture area exhibits a type of "tropical low-density urbanism" with large settlement sites controlling areas up to 500 km^2, connected by raised causeways and featuring civic-ceremonial architecture like stepped platforms, U-shaped structures, and pyramids.

In summary, the research indicates that pre-Columbian Amazonia was home to significantly larger and more permanent settlements than previously believed, challenging the conventional view of the region and suggesting a more complex and urbanized pre-contact landscape.
