# Soil Types Associated with Long-term Human Settlements in the Amazon
The Amazon region has been home to various human settlements for thousands of years, with some of these settlements leaving a lasting impact on the soil composition. Research has identified specific soil types that are associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon.

## Introduction
Long-term human settlements in the Amazon have been linked to the creation of specific soil types, often referred to as anthropogenic soils. These soils are a result of human activities such as agriculture, waste management, and habitation, which have altered the soil composition over time.

## Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs)
Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs), also known as "terra preta," are a type of anthropogenic soil that is commonly associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon. ADEs are characterized by their dark color, high fertility, and presence of ceramic shards, indicating former areas of habitation [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh8499).

## Terra Mulata
Another type of anthropogenic soil found in the Amazon is Terra Mulata, which is lighter in color and less fertile than ADEs. Terra Mulata is thought to be the result of old agricultural fields, but its origins are still debated [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4762.2011.00999.x).

## Continuum of Soil Fertility
Research suggests that rather than two distinct categories of anthrosols (ADEs and Terra Mulata), there may be a continuum of soil fertility between them. This continuum is thought to result from the overlapping and constantly changing boundaries of agricultural and habitational areas [onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4762.2011.00999.x).

## Regional Variations
Studies have also identified regional variations in soil types associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon. For example, in the lower Amazon Basin, geochemical signatures have been used to identify prehistoric settlement patterns [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312005523).

## Historical Landscape Domestication
In northwestern Amazonia, research has shown that ancient villages have given rise to "ancestral forests" with a high degree of past human modification. These forests exhibit a unique floristic structure and composition, with many tree species managed by indigenous communities [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112719304104).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the soil types most associated with long-term human settlements in the Amazon are Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) and Terra Mulata. However, research suggests that there may be a continuum of soil fertility between these two categories, and regional variations in soil types associated with human settlements.
