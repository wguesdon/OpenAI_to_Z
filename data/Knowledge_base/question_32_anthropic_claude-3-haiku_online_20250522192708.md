# Exploration and Descriptions of Amazonian Populations in the 16th-18th Centuries

## Question
What Spanish, Portuguese, and British expedition records from 1500-1800 describe large Amazon populations?

## Introduction
The Amazon Basin has long been a region of fascination and exploration for European powers. Throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, various Spanish, Portuguese, and British expeditions ventured into the Amazon rainforest, documenting their observations and encounters with the indigenous populations inhabiting the area. This report synthesizes the key findings from several historical sources that describe large Amazonian populations during this period.

## Expedition Records

### Francisco de Orellana's Voyage (1541-1542)
[readingtheperiphery.org](https://readingtheperiphery.org/herrera/) - In 1541, the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana led an expedition down the Amazon River after splitting off from Gonzalo Pizarro's overland expedition. Orellana's account, as recorded by Antonio de Herrera, describes encountering large settlements and towns along the river, as well as fierce female warriors, believed to be the origin of the term "Amazons."

### Pedro Teixeira's Expedition (1637-1639)
[zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/2486841/files/article.pdf) - In 1637, the Portuguese captain Pedro Teixeira led an expedition from Pará to Quito and back, exploring the length of the Amazon River. His account, as reported by the historian George Edmundson, describes encountering numerous indigenous settlements and towns along the river, some with populations estimated to be in the thousands.

### Jacinto de Carvalho's Ethnographic Report (1719)
[scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/bgoeldi/a/sSX5W64997j8HjzxKW9B3LM/?lang=pt) - In the early 18th century, the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jacinto de Carvalho spent 13 years working in the Amazon missions. He sent a detailed ethnographic report to his superiors, which, although only known through a contemporary Italian translation, provides valuable insights into the indigenous populations and their settlements in the region at the time.

### Colonial Collecting Expeditions (1750-1800)

These expeditions documented the diverse indigenous populations inhabiting the "sertão" (backlands) of the Amazon Basin.

## Conclusion
The expedition records from Spanish, Portuguese, and British explorers during the 16th-18th centuries provide a wealth of information about the large indigenous populations that inhabited the Amazon Basin. Accounts from Orellana, Teixeira, Carvalho, and various colonial collecting expeditions all describe encountering extensive settlements, towns, and populations along the Amazon River and its tributaries. These historical sources offer valuable insights into the scale and diversity of Amazonian societies prior to widespread European colonization.
