# Clusters of Non-Natural Soil Mounds (Terras Pretas) Visible on Soil Maps but Untested Archaeologically

**Question:**  
*Which clusters of non-natural soil mounds (terras pretas) are visible on soil maps but untested archaeologically?*

---

## Introduction

"Terras pretas" or Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile anthropogenic soils found throughout the Amazon Basin, formed by pre-Columbian indigenous populations through intensive and long-term soil amendment practices including charcoal, organic waste, and pottery fragments. These soil mounds reflect ancient human activity and can be seen as distinct soil patches or mounds on soil and satellite maps.

Many of these terras pretas sites have been archaeologically investigated, revealing significant human settlement and activity patterns. However, numerous clusters or patches of these soils appear in soil maps or remote sensing data but remain archaeologically untested or poorly studied.

## Known Distribution and Mapping of Terras Pretas

Research and mapping efforts highlight several known and probable clusters of terra preta in the Brazilian Amazon and surrounding areas. For example:

- The **Belterra Plateau region near Santarém in Pará, Brazil** is well documented for large-scale mechanized agriculture occurring on former terras pretas patches, revealed by satellite images and field surveys [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706116302725).
  
- The **Tocantins river region in Pará State**, Brazil, shows archaeological sites co-located with patches of terra preta soils, although many mapped soil clusters remain untested [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon).

- Other studies note a widespread pattern of dark earth soils in flat terraces and mound structures found in various locations throughout Amazonia, but emphasize the many clusters not yet subjected to systematic archaeological excavation [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259126195_Dark_earths_and_the_human_built_landscape_in_Amazonia_A_widespread_pattern_of_anthrosol_formation).

- In the Bolivian Amazon (Llanos de Moxos), clusters of raised fields and earthworks corresponding to modified soils have been studied to a limited extent, but soil heterogeneity implies there may be many more uncharted anthropogenic soil sites [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/7054791/Soil_properties_and_pre-Columbian_settlement_patterns_in_the_Monumental_Mounds_Region_of_the_Llanos_de_Moxos_Bolivian_Amazon).

## Clusters Visible on Soil Maps but Untested Archaeologically

### 1. Northern Pará and Tocantins River Basin  
Soil maps show numerous patches of terra preta derived from soil spectral and chemical signatures near the Tocantins River in Pará, Brazil. While some areas have been tested archaeologically, many mapped dark earth clusters have no formal archaeological excavation, often marked only by their soil properties and satellite signatures [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225848541_Distribution_of_Amazonian_Dark_Earths_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon).

### 2. Peripheral Areas Around the Belterra Plateau  
Though extensively studied in parts, peripheral additional black soil clusters and small mounds near the Belterra Plateau remain untested archaeologically but visible through Landsat and other remote sensing data [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706116302725).

### 3. Smaller Terrace and Mound Areas in Amazonia  
Several smaller-scale flat terraces and mound clusters identified by soil and remote sensing studies, such as around the Caldeirão archaeological site, correspond to dark earths but have not been systematically researched archaeologically beyond initial soil sampling [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259126195_Dark_earths_and_the_human_built_landscape_in_Amazonia_A_widespread_pattern_of_anthrosol_formation).

### 4. Llanos de Moxos Region in Bolivian Amazon  
The spatial distribution of earthworks and corresponding modified soil clusters in this region shows many raised fields and dark earth soils untested archaeologically, partially due to the enormous extent and environmental complexity [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/7054791/Soil_properties_and_pre-Columbian_settlement_patterns_in_the_Monumental_Mounds_Region_of_the_Llanos_de_Moxos_Bolivian_Amazon).

## Summary

- Numerous clusters and patches of terra preta soils are visible on soil maps or through remote sensing tools in Amazonian regions, including parts of Pará (Brazil), the Tocantins basin, peripheral zones near well-studied plateaus, and the Bolivian Amazon.

- Many of these soil clusters remain untested archaeologically, meaning formal excavations or archaeological surveys have not been conducted yet, limiting our understanding about their cultural origins or temporal use.

- Key hotspots evident on maps but lacking archaeological follow-up include outer belts of terra preta clusters in the Tocantins and Pará region, small terraces and mounds away from major sites like Caldeirão, and the wide expanses of earthworks in Llanos de Moxos.
