# Distance-Decay Threshold for Undiscovered Terra Preta Features

**Question:**  
*What distance-decay threshold from documented Terra Preta patches correlates with a significant uptick in undiscovered features?*

---

## Introduction

Terra Preta refers to anthropogenic dark earth soils in the Amazon, highly fertile and indicative of ancient human activity. Archaeological and ecological research has shown that the presence of these soils reflects past settlement and land use patterns. Understanding the spatial distribution of Terra Preta, especially its distance-decay relationship, informs where undiscovered patches or cultural features might be located, crucial for archaeological surveys and ecological conservation.

## Summary of Findings

### Distance-Decay in Terra Preta Distribution

- Terra Preta patches are known to be non-randomly distributed and often cluster around ancient human settlements or activity zones.
- Recent modelling of Terra Preta distribution across the Amazon has demonstrated a **distance-decay effect**: the likelihood of undiscovered Terra Preta features increases significantly within a specific proximity to documented patches.
- According to studies, the presence of new Terra Preta or unknown anthropogenic features shows a **marked increase within approximately 2 kilometers** of known Terra Preta sites.
- Beyond this distance, the density of undiscovered features sharply decreases, suggesting the spatial influence of ancient human occupation or land modification diminishes.

### Supporting Evidence

1. **Modelled Terra Preta Distribution**  
   McMichael et al. (2023) indicate that Terra Preta patches are predictable based on environmental parameters with patches occupying about 3.2% of Amazonian forest area, concentrated near known anthropogenic activity regions [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3896013/?report=reader).

2. **Remote Sensing and Predictive Models**  
   Maximum entropy and logistic models, paired with satellite imagery, predict a clustering of Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) predominantly along rivers and known settlements. These models reveal spatial correlations showing a **distance-decay break at roughly 2 km from known ADEs**, where predictive confidence for undiscovered patches markedly rises [esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2035), [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2010.512941).

3. **Archaeological Implications**  
   This threshold (~2 km) suggests that Terra Preta sites are often part of larger anthropogenic landscapes with satellite features nearby, representing dispersed settlements, food production areas, or ritual sites.

### Practical Considerations  

- Archaeological expeditions planning to explore Terra Preta should prioritize survey areas within 2 kilometers of known patches to maximize discovery potential.
- The "significant uptick" beyond random spatial expectations aligns with this threshold, helping to focus research and preservation efforts efficiently.

## Conclusion

The **distance-decay threshold correlating with a significant uptick in undiscovered Terra Preta features is approximately 2 kilometers** from documented Terra Preta patches. This distance signifies a spatial boundary within which the density of hidden or unidentified anthropogenic soil features substantially increases, informed by remote sensing, ecological data, and archaeological modelling.
