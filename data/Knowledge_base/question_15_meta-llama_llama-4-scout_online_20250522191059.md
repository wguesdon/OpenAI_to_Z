# National and State-Level Open-Data Portals for Site Prediction
## Introduction

The following report highlights national and state-level open-data portals that provide ancillary layers, such as hydrology, soils, roads, and deforestation, which can aid in site prediction.

## Question
What national or state-level open-data portals provide ancillary layers (hydrology, soils, roads, deforestation) that could help in site prediction?

## Available Portals

Several open-data portals offer valuable resources for site prediction. These portals are listed below:

### National Portals

* **[GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/)**: This portal provides access to federal geospatial data, including FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It offers various datasets, APIs, and tools for data discovery and utilization.
* **[USDA Geospatial Data Gateway](https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov/)**: The USDA's Geospatial Data Gateway provides access to a wide range of environmental and natural resources data, including hydrology, soils, and land cover. Users can browse, select, and download data in various formats.
* **[Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Geospatial Data](https://www.blm.gov/services/geospatial/GISData)**: The BLM's Geospatial Business Platform Hub offers a centralized location for exploring, viewing, and downloading BLM's geospatial data, including datasets relevant to site prediction.

### State Portals

* **[California State Geoportal](https://gis.data.ca.gov/)**: This portal provides access to California's geospatial data, including datasets related to hydrology, soils, and land cover. Users can utilize the OGC Records API for standardized metadata discovery.
* **[Washington State Geospatial Open Data Portal](https://geo.wa.gov/)**: The Washington State portal offers a wide range of geospatial data, including datasets relevant to site prediction. Users can access RSS feeds for updates, DCAT feeds for external catalog federation, and OGC Records API for metadata discovery.

## Conclusion

These national and state-level open-data portals provide valuable resources for site prediction. By leveraging these portals, users can access a wide range of ancillary layers, including hydrology, soils, roads, and deforestation, to support their site prediction endeavors.
