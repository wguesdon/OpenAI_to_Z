# Kuhikugu and Ancient Settlements in the Xingu River Region
## Introduction

The question at hand is: What are the distinctive features of Kuhikugu and other confirmed ancient settlements in the Xingu River region?

## Overview of Kuhikugu

Kuhikugu is an archaeological complex located in the Xingu River region of Brazil. The site includes twenty towns and villages spread over an area of around 7,700 square miles (20,000 km2), where close to 50,000 people may have once lived [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhikugu). The civilization is believed to have been inhabited from around 1,500 years ago to 400 years ago, when the people living there were likely killed by diseases brought over by Europeans.

## Distinctive Features of Kuhikugu and Other Ancient Settlements

The distinctive features of Kuhikugu and other confirmed ancient settlements in the Xingu River region include:

* **Complex built environment**: The headwater basin of the Xingu River has revealed a complex built environment, with settlement patterns and land-use that have implications for understanding the dynamics of natural-human systems in the Upper Xingu basin and other areas across the transitional forests of the southern Amazon [www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/2/1/1).
* **Large-scale transformations of local landscapes**: Archaeology and indigenous history of Native Amazonian peoples in the Upper Xingu region of Brazil reveal unexpectedly complex regional settlement patterns and large-scale transformations of local landscapes over the past millennium [www.academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/4360316/Pre_Columbian_Urbanism_Anthropogenic_Landscapes_and_the_Future_of_the_Amazon).
* **Dense late-prehistoric settlements**: Mapping and excavation of archaeological structures document pronounced human-induced alteration of the forest cover, particularly in relation to large, dense late-prehistoric settlements (circa 1200 to 1600 A.D.).
* **Manioc agriculture and sedentism**: The Upper Xingu example shows that manioc agriculture and sedentism were possible in Amazonia, despite common assumptions about the limitations of the region's soils and resources [www.cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/manioc-agriculture-and-sedentism-in-amazonia-the-upper-xingu-example/39CA7051992BFABF4FD4DD4193BC58BA).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Kuhikugu and other confirmed ancient settlements in the Xingu River region are characterized by their complex built environment, large-scale transformations of local landscapes, dense late-prehistoric settlements, and manioc agriculture and sedentism.
