# Revealing Subsurface Geoglyphs through Modern Roadcuts, Logging Gaps, and Fire Scars in Time-Series Imagery

**Question Restated:**  
How do modern roadcuts, logging gaps, and fire scars reveal subsurface geoglyphs when viewed in time-series imagery?

## Introduction

Subsurface geoglyphs, ancient ground designs often buried beneath soil and vegetation, can be difficult to detect using standard observation methods. However, certain modern landscape disturbances—namely roadcuts, logging gaps, and fire scars—can expose or highlight these hidden archaeological features. When analyzed using time-series satellite or aerial imagery, these disturbances become invaluable for archaeologists aiming to identify and monitor geoglyphs that are otherwise invisible.

## Mechanisms of Reveal in Time-Series Imagery

### 1. **Vegetation Removal or Alteration**

- **Roadcuts and Logging Gaps:**  
  These activities physically remove or disturb vegetation and topsoil, which normally conceals geoglyph patterns beneath. This exposure provides high contrast between the disturbed areas and surrounding undisturbed vegetation, making the outlines or negative shapes of geoglyphs more apparent.  
  For example, logging gaps may create rectangular or linear clearings that reveal underlying soil textures that coincide with geoglyph outlines.

- **Fire Scars:**  
  Fire removes or scorches vegetation, altering surface reflectance and often changing soil color temporarily. This creates a contrast visible in multispectral or even normal RGB satellite imagery. The pattern of a geoglyph can manifest as differential burn severity or regrowth rates on soil types exposed by prior disturbances.

### 2. **Soil and Substrate Exposure**

- Roadcuts expose fresh soil layers that may differ in color and texture from surface gravel or vegetation-covered layers.  
- These differences in soil reflectance are captured in high-spatial-resolution imagery, where the contrast can delineate geoglyph shapes against the surrounding landscape.

### 3. **Temporal Changes and Multitemporal Analysis**

- **Time-series imagery** leverages repeated observations over weeks, months, or years to isolate persistent features such as the outlines of geoglyphs hidden by transient effects like seasonal vegetation changes.  
- By comparing imagery before and after disturbances like road construction or fires, archaeologists can detect patterns that appear only when vegetation is removed or stressed.  
- This multitemporal approach helps filter out noise caused by natural environmental changes, enhancing feature detection reliability [Alders et al., 2024].

## Practical Examples and Studies

- The **Nasca Lines in Peru**, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, have been extensively studied using satellite and airborne remote sensing. Modern disturbances such as roadcuts and fire scars reveal subsurface geoglyphs by exposing contrasting soil or by changing vegetation cover, which can then be detected in time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or optical satellite imagery [Tapete, 2018] [Comer, 2017].  
- Combining Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry with satellite imagery enables highly detailed digital elevation models (DEM) and orthophotos that can assess damage or reveal previously hidden features facilitated by disturbances [Hall, 2015].  
- Advanced methods applying AI and high-resolution LiDAR micro-topography data allow precise modeling of flood and erosion risk factors, which interact with these disturbed sites, highlighting vulnerable geoglyphs near modern intrusion zones like highways [Sakai et al., 2024].

## Conclusion

Modern roadcuts, logging gaps, and fire scars act as natural or anthropogenic "windows" into the subsurface by removing or altering surface vegetation and soil layers, thus exposing or emphasizing the geometric patterns of geoglyphs. Time-series satellite imagery analysis leverages these episodic disturbances to detect and monitor these cultural heritage features with greater precision by:

- Enhancing contrast between disturbed and undisturbed areas,
- Revealing soil or substrate differences associated with geoglyphs,
- Using multitemporal data to distinguish persistent archaeological features from transient natural changes.

This synergy between modern land disturbances and advanced remote sensing techniques allows archaeologists to non-invasively study and preserve subsurface landscape heritage in ways previously not possible.
