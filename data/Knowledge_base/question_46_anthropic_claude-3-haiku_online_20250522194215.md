# Participatory Mapping and Story-Mapping Revealing Undocumented Archaeological Features

## Question
How have community-led participatory mapping or story-mapping projects revealed undocumented archaeological features?

## Introduction
Participatory mapping and story-mapping approaches have emerged as powerful tools in archaeology, allowing communities to actively engage in the documentation and interpretation of cultural heritage sites. These methods can be particularly effective in revealing undocumented archaeological features that may have been overlooked or marginalized in traditional top-down approaches. This report examines several case studies that demonstrate how community-led initiatives have uncovered previously unknown archaeological sites and landscape features.

## Case Studies

### Cerro Quemado Site in Argentina
[onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1794) describes how a participatory mapping project with local students and teachers in north-western Argentina led to the discovery and documentation of the Cerro Quemado site. This site exhibits a local Inka architectural pattern and is situated along a major Inka road, providing important insights into the expansion of the Inka empire in the region. The use of drone technology and photogrammetry further facilitated the quick and cost-effective mapping of the site's architectural features.

### Native Settlements in Central California
[www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00934690.2017.1416849) explores how historical maps, such as diseños and plats from the Mexican-era land grants, as well as early maps from the General Land Office and United States Coast Survey, can be used to discover and interpret archaeological deposits of Native American settlements in central California during the mid-19th century. This approach helps to uncover sites that are poorly represented in the historical and archaeological records.

### Gummingurru Stone Arrangement Site in Australia
[www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03122417.2018.1455289) discusses the challenges of documenting the Gummingurru Aboriginal stone arrangement site in Queensland, Australia, which has undergone constant change and maintenance over time. The article demonstrates the need for archaeologists to adopt "counter-mapping" approaches that capture the intangible and ever-evolving nature of such culturally significant sites.

### Ida Bell Cemetery in Arkansas
[archeology.uark.edu](https://archeology.uark.edu/ida-bell-cemetery/) describes a project by the Arkansas Archeological Survey to map the Ida Bell Cemetery, a historic African American cemetery in Faulkner County. By utilizing modern mapping technologies, the team was able to document over 125 grave locations, which had previously been obscured by overgrowth.

## Conclusion
The case studies presented in this report demonstrate how community-led participatory mapping and story-mapping projects have been instrumental in revealing undocumented archaeological features and sites. These approaches allow for the active engagement of local communities, the incorporation of traditional knowledge, and the use of innovative technologies, all of which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of cultural heritage landscapes. Embracing these collaborative methodologies can contribute to the discovery, documentation, and preservation of archaeological resources that may have been marginalized or overlooked in the past.
