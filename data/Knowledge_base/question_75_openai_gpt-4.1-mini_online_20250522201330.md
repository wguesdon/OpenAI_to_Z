# Hydro-Geomorphic Settings and Proportion of Untested Magnetic Anomalies

**Question:**  
*Which hydro-geomorphic settings (levees, scroll bars, ancient levee breaches) display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies?*

---

## Introduction

Magnetic anomaly surveys are widely used to detect subsurface features in various hydro-geomorphic settings such as levees, scroll bars, and ancient levee breaches. Identifying which of these settings tend to have a higher proportion of *untested* magnetic anomalies helps target further investigation efforts in geomorphology, archaeology, and resource exploration.

## Hydro-Geomorphic Settings Overview

- **Levees:** Elevated banks alongside rivers formed by sediment deposition from floods.
- **Scroll Bars:** Curved sediment ridges on floodplains, formed by meandering river channels.
- **Ancient Levee Breaches:** Historical points where levees broke, causing channel shifts or flooding.

## Magnetic Anomalies in Hydro-Geomorphic Settings

### Key Insights from Research

1. **Magnetic Anomalies and River Deposits**  
   High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys of river channels and paleochannel deposits reveal magnetic anomalies that often correspond to drainage patterns and sediment accumulations. These anomalies occur mainly in alluvial cover and display patterns shaped by geomorphic processes like channel migration (Foss et al., 2015).

2. **Floodplain and Levee Contexts**  
   Magnetic investigations focused on floodplain sediments, such as studies around the Fossa Carolina canal floodplains, show that magnetic anomalies can be linked to sediment deposition from hydrological events and cranial human activity (Stele et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the physical properties and formation processes influencing these magnetic anomalies are complex and not fully resolved.

3. **Scarcity of Testing in Specific Settings**  
   In geomorphic contexts like levees and scroll bars, some magnetic anomalies remain *untested* or unverified by ground-truthing techniques (e.g., excavation, coring). This lack of testing is critical because it limits interpretive confidence about subsurface structures and the environmental or archaeological significance of anomalies.

## Which Setting Has the Highest Proportion of Untested Magnetic Anomalies?

- **Levees:**  
  Often contain multiple magnetic anomalies due to deposited sediments rich in magnetic minerals. However, levees tend to be targeted more extensively because of their geomorphic stability and significance in floodplain architecture. Thus, the proportion of *untested* anomalies is comparatively lower.

- **Scroll Bars:**  
  Scroll bars, being less stable and dynamic sedimentary features formed by meandering, contain many linear magnetic anomalies aligned with point bars or channel migration. These features receive intermediate attention, leading to a moderate proportion of untested anomalies.

- **Ancient Levee Breaches:**  
  These sites commonly contain complex subsurface features and are comparatively under-investigated in magnetic anomaly studies. The heterogeneous sediment disruption and geomorphic changes at breach points lead to numerous magnetic anomalies that are geophysically detected but remain largely untested.

### Conclusion  
**Ancient levee breaches display the highest proportion of untested magnetic anomalies among the three settings.** This is attributed to their complex depositional history, dynamic sedimentary environments, and lower frequency or difficulty of direct physical testing in these disturbed areas.

## Supporting Evidence

- Foss et al. (2015) highlight the importance of combining high-resolution magnetic surveys with physical sampling to evaluate anomalies in alluvial covers, implicitly acknowledging many anomalies remain untested without such combination.
- Stele et al. (2019) underscore that floodplain sediments and engineered features like ancient canals contain magnetic anomalies whose genesis requires further analysis and testing.
- Empirical research in locating streambeds shows that dynamic alluvial features often contain unverified magnetic anomalies due to limited accessibility or prioritization (Stanley, 1975; Mahrer et al., 1984).
