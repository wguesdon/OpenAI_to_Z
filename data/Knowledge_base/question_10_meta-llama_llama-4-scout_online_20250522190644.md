# Public Multispectral Satellite Data for Target Region
==============================================

## Introduction

The question at hand is to identify public multispectral satellite data available for a target region. While the specific target region is not mentioned, we can discuss various public multispectral satellite data sources that can be utilized for different regions.

## Public Multispectral Satellite Data Sources

Several public multispectral satellite data sources are available, including:

### 1. Sentinel-2

The Sentinel-2 mission, part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program, provides high-resolution multispectral imagery. It consists of two satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, launched in 2015 and 2017, respectively. The data is freely available and can be accessed through various platforms, including [sentinels.copernicus.eu](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/copernicus/sentinel-2) and [dataspace.copernicus.eu](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-2).

### 2. Landsat Missions

The Landsat program, managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), provides multispectral data for land and coastal areas. The data is available through the USGS website ([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/data)).

### 3. Earth Observing One (EO-1) - Hyperion

The EO-1 satellite, operated by NASA, provides hyperspectral data, which can be used for multispectral analysis. The data is archived at the USGS EROS Center ([usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-earth-observing-one-eo-1-hyperion)).

## Data Characteristics

The characteristics of these data sources vary:

* **Sentinel-2**: Provides 13 spectral bands, with a spatial resolution of 10-60 meters and a temporal resolution of 5-10 days.
* **Landsat Missions**: Offers 7-11 spectral bands, with a spatial resolution of 15-30 meters and a temporal resolution of 16-30 days.
* **EO-1 - Hyperion**: Provides 242 spectral bands, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and a temporal resolution of 16-30 days.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, several public multispectral satellite data sources are available for different regions, including Sentinel-2, Landsat Missions, and EO-1 - Hyperion. The choice of data source depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as spatial and temporal resolution, and spectral bands.
