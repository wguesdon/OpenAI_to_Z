# Geographic Areas with High Archaeological Potential but Unsurveyed

## Question
What geographic areas have high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed?

## Overview
Based on the web search results provided, several geographic areas in the western United States appear to have high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed or have limited archaeological investigation:

1. Northeast Wyoming
2. Central Arizona
3. Southwestern Wyoming
4. West Texas
5. Southwest Wyoming

The search results provide some context and details about the archaeological potential and survey status of these regions, which are summarized in the following sections.

## Northeast Wyoming
The search result for [Northeast Wyoming](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/10699/northeast-wyoming) indicates that this region has archaeological resources, but the details are limited to a citation record. The document cited does not appear to be available, and the summary states that the Center for Digital Antiquity does not have a copy of the document. This suggests that the archaeological resources in northeast Wyoming may not have been fully surveyed or documented.

## Central Arizona
The search result for [Central Arizona](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/76636/central-az) mentions an archaeological site (AZT:4:38(ASM)) where pollen analysis was conducted to identify cultural activities and agricultural crops. This suggests that central Arizona has archaeological sites with the potential for further investigation and study.

## Southwestern Wyoming
The search result for [Southwestern Wyoming](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/4154/southwestern-wyoming) describes an archaeological survey conducted in the Fossil Butte National Monument in the 1970s. This indicates that at least some parts of southwestern Wyoming have been surveyed, but the document summary suggests that there may be other unsurveyed areas in the region with archaeological potential.

## West Texas
The search result for [West Texas](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/4151/west-texas) is another citation record with limited information. Similar to the northeast Wyoming result, the document referenced is not available, and the summary indicates that the Center for Digital Antiquity does not have a copy. This suggests that west Texas may have unexplored archaeological resources.

## Southwest Wyoming
The search result for [Southwest Wyoming](https://core.tdar.org/browse/geographic-keyword/4048/southwest-wyoming) is also a citation record with limited information. As with the other regions, this suggests that there may be areas in southwest Wyoming with high archaeological potential that have not been fully surveyed or documented.

## Conclusion
The web search results indicate that several regions in the western United States, including northeast Wyoming, central Arizona, southwestern Wyoming, west Texas, and southwest Wyoming, have high potential for archaeological sites but remain unsurveyed or have limited archaeological investigation. Further research and field surveys in these areas could uncover significant archaeological resources and expand our understanding of the region's cultural history.
