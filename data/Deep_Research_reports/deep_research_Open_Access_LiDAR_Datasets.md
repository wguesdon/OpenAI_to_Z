# Open-Access LiDAR Datasets in the Brazilian Amazon for Archaeological Research

Question: Identify open-access LIDAR datasets that cover portions of the Brazilian Amazon and are suitable for identifying archaeological sites.
- NASA/Embrapa Sustainable Landscapes LiDAR (2008–2018) – High-resolution airborne LiDAR surveys over select sites in Amazonian Brazil (Acre, Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, etc.). Collected to monitor forest biomass and carbon, these data (point clouds, ~10 points/m²) are freely available in 1 km² tiles
daac.ornl.gov
. Archaeologists can derive detailed Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the point clouds to reveal earthworks or mounds beneath forest canopies. Access via NASA ORNL DAAC (requires free EarthData login)
daac.ornl.gov
.
- Manaus Region Forest LiDAR (2008) – Airborne LiDAR data covering forest research sites near Manaus (Cuieiras Biological Reserve, Adolpho Ducke Reserve, and BDFFP fragmented forests)
daac.ornl.gov
daac.ornl.gov
. Includes raw point clouds and ready-made DTMs (GeoTIFF) at ~1 m resolution. Useful for detecting subtle topographic features under dense rainforest canopy. Openly downloadable from the ORNL DAAC (NASA)
daac.ornl.gov
.
- Tapajós National Forest LiDAR (2008) – Airborne LiDAR surveys in Tapajós (Pará state) covering areas around two flux towers and selectively logged sites
daac.ornl.gov
. Provides point cloud data plus 1 m resolution DTM grids
daac.ornl.gov
daac.ornl.gov
, allowing identification of anthropogenic land features (e.g. ancient mounds or roads) in a terra firme forest environment. Available free through ORNL DAAC

.
- EBA Amazon LiDAR Transects (2016–2018) – A large set of 901 sampled LiDAR transects across the Brazilian Amazon from the Estimating Biomass in Amazonia (EBA) project
nature.com
. Each 12.5 km × 0.3 km strip (~375 ha) was flown with ~4 pts/m² density using a Trimble Harrier 68i system
zenodo.org
. The data (LAS point clouds) are open-access via Zenodo, enabling high-resolution elevation models for detecting pre-Columbian earthworks or raised fields where transects overlap archaeological sites.
- NASA GEDI Satellite LiDAR (2019–2023) – The GEDI mission provides spaceborne LiDAR coverage of the Amazon with billions of laser shots. Each GEDI footprint is ~25 m in diameter (samples every ~60 m along orbit tracks)
sciencedirect.com
. While it doesn’t produce continuous maps, the open GEDI dataset (via NASA Earthdata) offers forest canopy height and ground elevation measurements that could hint at large-scale anthropogenic landforms. GEDI data are free to download, though fine-scale features require airborne LiDAR for clear detection.
