## Article Summary: 'Many features of the Amazon are man-made': Q&A with archaeologist Eduardo Neves

### Key Points

**Main Discovery**: Archaeological research reveals that the Amazon Rainforest has been significantly shaped by human activity for thousands of years, challenging the long-held belief that it was a pristine wilderness unsuitable for agriculture or large populations.

### Paradigm Shifts in Amazon Archaeology

1. **Human Presence**: Evidence shows humans have inhabited the Amazon for over 12,000 years, with the central Amazon showing occupation dating back 8,500 years.

2. **Population Estimates**: Pre-European conquest population estimates have been revised from minimal to 6-10 million people across the greater Amazon region.

3. **Agricultural Heritage**: The Amazon was one of the world's main centers of plant cultivation, domesticating crops including:
   - Manioc
   - Cacao
   - Papaya
   - Peanuts
   - Tobacco
   - Rice (evidence dating back 4,000 years)

### Key Archaeological Findings

- **Casarabe Culture (Bolivia)**: Lidar technology revealed hidden settlements with:
  - Stepped platforms and conical pyramids
  - Causeways linking settlements
  - Massive water management infrastructure

- **Central Amazon**: Large central plazas, earthworks, and evidence of diverse settlement patterns

- **Southwest Amazon (Rondônia)**: 
  - Uninterrupted human occupation dating to 9,000 BCE
  - Artificial shell mounts (160m long, 6m high)
  - Evidence of early plant cultivation

### Technical Advances Enabling Discoveries

- **Lidar remote sensing**: Reveals structures hidden under forest canopy
- **Microscopic analysis**: Phytoliths and starch grains from decomposed plants
- **Isotope analysis**: Reveals ancient diets
- **DNA research**: Traces plant domestication
- **Improved carbon dating**: More accurate timeline establishment

### The "Biocultural Heritage" Concept

Eduardo Neves argues that the Amazon should be understood not just as natural heritage but as **biocultural heritage**, where:
- Human activity enhanced biodiversity
- Many large nut and fruit trees result from Indigenous practices
- The forest and human culture are "fully intertwined and impossible to untangle"

### Modern Implications

1. **Conservation Approach**: The forest needs people for protection - the idea of wilderness without humans "does not make sense"

2. **Agricultural Models**: Traditional agroforestry practices (like 300-400 year old Brazil nut trees) represent truly intensive agriculture

3. **Current Threats**: Modern exploitation (soy, cattle, gold mining) has destroyed 20% of the rainforest in 50 years, with only half remaining productive

### About Eduardo Neves

- Professor of Archaeology at University of São Paulo
- 30+ years of Amazon research experience
- Author of "Under the times of the equinox: 8,000 years of history in central Amazon" (2022)
- Pioneer in recognizing Indigenous intellectual contributions to archaeology

### Historical Context

The article explains how early European accounts (like Gaspar de Carvajal's 16th-century manuscript) describing populous Amazon settlements were dismissed for centuries because:
- Later naturalists found few people (not recognizing depopulation from disease and colonialism)
- Organic building materials had decomposed
- Comparison with stone monuments of Inca/Maya civilizations

This research fundamentally changes our understanding of the Amazon from a "green hell" unsuitable for civilization to a landscape actively managed and enhanced by Indigenous peoples for millennia.
