# Suspected Unconfirmed Archaeological Sites in the Brazilian Amazon (2015–2025)

What are the locations of suspected archaeological sites in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest from the literature that have not yet been confirmed


Upper Xingu, Mato Grosso (Southern Amazonia) – A fortified village site (an ancient plaza-town) identified via LiDAR in the Upper Xingu Basin. It consists of a ditched enclosure with a central plaza, similar in layout to other large pre-Columbian ring villages. The site remains unexcavated and was detected beneath the forest canopy, suggesting a significant pre-Columbian settlement awaiting field verification

. Southwestern Amazon (Acre/Purus-Madeira Region) – Multiple geoglyph earthworks (rectangular and circular ditched enclosures) were revealed by LiDAR on flat interfluvial terrain near tributaries of the Purus and Madeira rivers. These geometric earthworks – likely defensive or ceremonial sites built ~2,000 years ago – have no visible connecting roads and are dispersed across well-drained upland plateaus. They have been documented only remotely and not yet confirmed on the ground

. Upper Tapajós Basin (Pará/Mato Grosso) – An extensive cluster of 81 newly identified prehistoric sites (ditched enclosures and mound villages) was reported in the headwaters of the Tapajós River. These sites form a vast network of fortified villages dating to ca. AD 1250–1500, spanning ~1,800 km across southern Amazonia

. The discovery was made through remote surveys, filling a gap in Amazonian archaeology, and most of these sites remain unexcavated pending field investigation

. Central Amazon Floodplain (Amazon River Basin) – Two large earthwork features were detected on the floodplains of the central Amazon via remote sensing. These straight-edged, geometric structures—distinct from known upland earthworks—are suspected to be anthropogenic (possibly ancient fish weirs or water management structures) due to their shape and placement

. Ongoing sedimentation may have buried smaller features around them, so their function is hypothesized from context and they await on-site verification

. Acre State, Western Amazon – At least 13 previously unrecorded geoglyph sites (large geometric earthen enclosures) were identified in Acre through predictive modeling and satellite analysis. These newly discovered earthworks expand the known distribution of Acre’s famous geoglyph complexes. They are thought to represent ceremonial centers or habitation sites in currently forested areas, and remain unconfirmed by excavation to date

. Eastern Amazon (Along Major Rivers) – Numerous high-probability sites of terra preta (anthropogenic Amazonian Dark Earth soils) have been predicted along the Amazon River and its eastern tributaries by recent modeling studies

. These fertile dark earth patches, often associated with pre-Columbian habitation, are hypothesized to form an “arc” of ancient settlements in central and eastern Amazonia. They have been identified via satellite-derived vegetation and soil signals, but most have not yet been ground-truthed, representing targets for future archaeological surveys
