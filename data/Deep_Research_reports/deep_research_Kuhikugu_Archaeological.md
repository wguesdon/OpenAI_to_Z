# Kuhikugu Archaeological Complex – Location and Geography #

Find the central GPS coordinates of the Kuhikugu archaeological complex in Brazil. Also provide relevant geographical context, such as its proximity to major rivers (e.g., the Xingu River), terrain type, vegetation, and surrounding features. GPS Coordinates: The approximate central coordinates of the Kuhikugu complex (site X11) are 12°33′30″S, 53°6′40″W (about -12.5583, -53.1111)

. This marks the location near the eastern shore of Lake Kuhikugu (now called Lagoa Dourada) in Brazil.

## Geographical Context

Map showing the Kuhikugu cluster in the Upper Xingu region. Site X11 (Kuhikugu) is located by “Lac Kuhikugu” (Lake Kuhikugu/Lagoa Dourada) at the southern end. The red dot in the inset (lower left) indicates the region within Brazil.

Region and Rivers: Kuhikugu lies at the headwaters of the Xingu River in the southern Amazon basin
en.wikipedia.org
. It is situated in Mato Grosso state, within or adjacent to the Xingu Indigenous Park (Parque do Xingu), a protected area for indigenous peoples
en.wikipedia.org
. The site is near a large upland lake (Lagoa Dourada) and a network of waterways that join to form the Xingu River’s main stem

. In fact, the Upper Xingu headwaters region contains extensive lakes, natural canals, and wooded islands at the river’s origin

Terrain and Elevation: The terrain is generally flat to gently undulating lowland. Kuhikugu sits in a broad depression of the Mato Grosso plateau, roughly a few hundred meters above sea level. The surrounding area forms part of the Upper Xingu basin, which is characterized by seasonally flooded wetlands and alluvial plains. Large portions of the headwaters are wetlands with marshes, lagoons, and periodically flooded forests and savannas

. To the south, the landscape transitions into drier tropical savanna, whereas to the north it grades into dense Amazon rainforest as one moves downriver

.
Vegetation: The site lies on the southern edge of the Amazon Rainforest belt
en.wikipedia.org
. Vegetation in the Kuhikugu area is predominantly tropical moist forest, interspersed with patches of woodland/savanna due to the transitional climate and seasonal flooding. Notably, the ancient inhabitants enriched the soil with terra preta (anthropogenic dark earth), so today the forest growth at Kuhikugu differs from untouched rainforest – a legacy of past human cultivation
en.wikipedia.org
. This cultural forest is richer in certain species and surrounded by more pristine jungle. Overall, the area is a mix of humid evergreen rainforest, gallery forests along waterways, and open wetland-savanna mosaics, all sustained by the Xingu’s headwater ecology
