## Geoglyphs of Acre (Acre State)

Coordinates: ~9.05° S, 70.53° W
The Geoglyphs of Acre are a collection of hundreds of large geometric earthworks in the southwestern Amazon, first revealed by deforestation in recent decades
theartnewspaper.com
theartnewspaper.com
. Recognized as a cultural heritage site (on Brazil’s tentative UNESCO World Heritage list since 2015)
whc.unesco.org
, these archaeological enclosures were built by pre-colonial societies between roughly 200 BC and 1300 AD
en.wikipedia.org
. They are mostly found on well-drained upland terrain between small rivers and wetlands in eastern Acre, especially near tributaries like the Acre and Iquiri Rivers
en.wikipedia.org
. This location choice kept them above seasonal floods (elevation in the area is generally a few hundred meters above sea level). Originally hidden under dense rainforest, the geometric ditches and mounds only became visible after modern land clearing
theartnewspaper.com
. Today they are often in pastures or agricultural fields, illustrating both their proximity to water and the fertile terra firme soils that favored ancient habitation
en.wikipedia.org
theartnewspaper.com
. The geoglyph sites remain relatively remote, but increasing farm expansion has made them more accessible – and more vulnerable – prompting calls for stronger legal protection

## Monte Alegre Rock Art (Pará State)

Coordinates: ~1.99° S, 54.07° W
On the north shore of the Amazon River in Pará lies the Monte Alegre State Park, home to caves and rock shelters adorned with prehistoric cave paintings
en.wikipedia.org
theartnewspaper.com
. The most famous site is Caverna da Pedra Pintada (“Painted Rock Cave”), an archaeological cave with evidence of human presence dating back over 11,000 years
en.wikipedia.org
. This site – protected as a state heritage park since 2001 – sits on sandstone hills rising above the surrounding lowland rainforest
theartnewspaper.com
. Its altitude (the cave is located in cliff faces ~100 m above the Amazon floodplain) ensured good drainage and dry shelter, while still being near rich river resources
en.wikipedia.org
. The vegetation around Monte Alegre is a mix of dense forest in the lowlands and more sparse cover or scrub on the rocky hills. Indeed, the rock art sites were long isolated in thick jungle, but are now “encircled by deforestation and development, including the expansion of agriculture, livestock and illegal mining”
theartnewspaper.com
. Despite newfound road access via the town of Monte Alegre, the area remains fairly remote. Visitors must traverse the Amazon River and then hike into the park’s interior. The common geographical threads here are clear: proximity to a major river (the Amazon), location on elevated bluffs above swampy ground, and an ecotone environment (forest-edge cliffs) that offered both resources and refuge.

## Marajó Island Mounds (Pará State)

Coordinates: ~0.85° S, 48.50° W
Marajó, the world’s largest fluvial island at the mouth of the Amazon, harbors numerous archaeological sites officially noted by Brazilian heritage authorities
nowboarding.com.br
. The most noteworthy are pre-Columbian mound complexes built by the Marajoara culture (c. 400–1300 AD). These sites – often in the Salvaterra region of eastern Marajó – include funerary mounds and shell middens (sambaquis) constructed on slightly higher ground
nowboarding.com.br
. By heaping earth, pottery, and shells, Marajó’s ancient inhabitants created artificial hills rising a few meters above the flat floodplain. This elevation was crucial: Marajó’s terrain is low-lying and seasonally flooded, consisting of waterlogged soils and savanna-like fields with patches of forest. The archaeological mounds provided dry, habitable surfaces and burial grounds in a landscape otherwise dominated by swamps
nowboarding.com.br
. Commonly these sites are located near waterways such as lagoons or river channels – for example, close to the Pará River or Amazon delta inlets – reflecting the importance of aquatic resources. The surrounding vegetation is not dense rainforest but rather varzea (flooded grasslands and forest islands), requiring human adaptation. Despite being near large rivers and the Atlantic, Marajó’s sites were historically isolated; even today, reaching them often involves boat travel. Their shared geographical traits include immediate proximity to water, flat alluvial setting, and the need for elevation (mound-building) to cope with poor drainage and seasonal inundation

## Pedra Pintada (Roraima State)

Coordinates: ~4.40° N, 61.10° W
Pedra Pintada (“Painted Rock”) is a massive rock outcrop with a cave, located in the savanna of northern Roraima. This site – in the municipality of Pacaraima on the Boa Vista savanna – has been studied by archaeologists and is in the process of being formally protected (it lies within the São Marcos Indigenous Reserve)
en.wikipedia.org
web.archive.org
. The rock is about 35 m tall, and its cave and exterior walls bear ancient pictographs. Excavations have uncovered pottery shards, stone tools, and burials, indicating habitation as early as ~2000 BC
en.wikipedia.org
. Geographically, Pedra Pintada stands out in an open tropical savanna (lavrado), a very different setting from the dense rainforest to the south. The site’s elevation is modest (the base is relatively low in the savanna plain, a few hundred meters above sea level, with hills nearby), but it is well above any river floodplains. It is near headwater streams of the Branco River basin, though not immediately adjacent to a major river. Vegetation cover is sparse grassland with isolated trees; the rock itself provided shelter and vantage in this open landscape
en.wikipedia.org
. Its remoteness historically preserved the paintings, but today the site can be visited with permission (it’s “open to visitors” in a controlled manner)
nowboarding.com.br
. In summary, Pedra Pintada’s location illustrates ancient people utilizing a savanna–forest transition zone – benefiting from drier ground and rock shelters, while still exploiting nearby waterways and forest resources. The common features it shares with other Amazon sites include a strategic setting on well-drained terrain and relative isolation (indigenous reserve lands) that has limited modern disturbances

## Calçoene Megalithic Circle (Amapá State)

Coordinates: ~2.50° N, 50.95° W
In the far north of Brazil, along the transition between rainforest and coastal savanna, lies the Parque Arqueológico do Solstício in Calçoene, Amapá. Discovered in 2005–2006, this site – often dubbed the “Amazon Stonehenge” – is now recognized and protected by IPHAN as an important archaeological heritage of the Amazon
facebook.com
nowboarding.com.br
. It consists of 127 granite blocks arranged upright in a large circle on top of a hill
nowboarding.com.br
. Researchers have shown the megaliths align with the sun’s position on the winter solstice (December 21–22), suggesting an astronomical observatory function
en.wikipedia.org
. The Calçoene megalithic site is situated ~16 km from the Atlantic coast, near the Cunani River in an area of tropical coastal plain. Unlike the dense rainforest interior, this region’s geography is characterized by rolling savanna and patchy forests on well-drained laterite hills. The stone circle itself occupies a hillock rising above surrounding wetlands – a strategic choice for ceremonies and observations, keeping it dry year-round. The soil is relatively firm and not prone to flooding at that spot (nearby areas receive extremely high rainfall, but runoff drains into the lowlands)
revistapesquisa.fapesp.br
en.wikipedia.org
. Vegetation around the site is a mosaic of grassland and shrubs, with the Amazon jungle proper beginning further inland. Accessibility remains limited: Calçoene is remote (about 460 km north of the state capital Macapá
revistapesquisa.fapesp.br
) and the site requires travel by rough roads, preserving its pristine condition. Shared geographical features are evident – proximity to water (close to rivers and coast) yet on elevated ground (hilltop), and location in an ecotonal environment (savanna–forest mix) that likely offered both rich marine/riverine resources and a habitable, well-drained setting for its builders

## Shared Geographical Characteristics of Amazon Archaeological Sites

Despite the diversity of these sites, they exhibit several common geographical traits:
Proximity to Water: All the sites are located near major water systems – typically within reach of rivers, floodplains or coasts. This includes the Amazon River itself (Monte Alegre, Marajó)
en.wikipedia.org
nowboarding.com.br
, tributaries like the Acre River for the geoglyphs
en.wikipedia.org
, or lakes and wetlands in their vicinity. Easy access to waterways provided food (fishing and hunting in rich aquatic ecosystems) and transportation routes, which was vital for sustaining large prehistoric communities.
Elevated, Well-Drained Terrain: The ancient inhabitants consistently chose or created sites on higher ground to avoid flooding and excess moisture. Examples include natural hills and rock shelters (Monte Alegre’s hills
theartnewspaper.com
, Pedra Pintada’s rock outcrop
en.wikipedia.org
, Calçoene’s hilltop
en.wikipedia.org
) as well as artificial mounds (Marajó’s constructed earthworks
nowboarding.com.br
). Even the Acre geoglyphs lie on terra firme interfluves – plateaus between streams and swamps
en.wikipedia.org
 – rather than in low floodable valleys. This ensures better drainage, drier soils for settlements, and protection from seasonal inundation.
Fertile Soils and Anthropogenic Landscapes: Many sites are associated with rich soils or human-modified earth. The presence of Amazonian Dark Earth (terra preta) is often noted in and around habitation sites (e.g. middens on Marajó, ancient garden soils in Acre), indicating long-term soil enrichment by past populations
news.mongabay.com
nowboarding.com.br
. Good soil fertility and drainage would have supported agriculture (such as cassava cultivation) and dense populations. In effect, the geography of these sites often reflects intentional landscape management – for instance, clearing vegetation and enriching soil in settlements, or even aligning stones and earthworks with celestial events (as seen in Calçoene) to imbue the landscape with cultural significance.
Vegetation: Forest Edges and Savanna Transitions: Rather than lying deep in uninterrupted rainforest, these sites tend to occur in ecotones or clearer areas – places with a mix of forest and open environments. Some were naturally in savanna or semi-open settings (the Roraima and Amapá sites are in the Guiana Shield’s savanna belt
en.wikipedia.org
nowboarding.com.br
), while others created openings in the forest (e.g. Acre’s earthworks were “largely unrecorded until recent satellite imaging,” as deforestation revealed them
theartnewspaper.com
theartnewspaper.com
). Monte Alegre’s rock art is on cliff faces above the rainforest, an interface of rock and jungle
theartnewspaper.com
. This pattern suggests ancient people often settled on the margins of dense forest – along rivers, coasts, or natural clearings – where they could harness diverse resources (both forest products and open-land farming or game). These edge locations are also where modern discovery is easiest, since dense canopy often concealed sites until logging or erosion exposed them
theartnewspaper.com
.
Remoteness and Accessibility: Historically, these sites were in remote, hard-to-reach locations, which helped preserve them. Many remained unknown to science until the late 20th century because of the Amazon’s vast, inaccessible nature (e.g. Acre’s geoglyphs only identified via aerial surveys post-deforestation
theartnewspaper.com
). Even today, reaching sites like Monte Alegre or Calçoene involves significant travel, and some lie within protected indigenous lands (e.g. Pedra Pintada, São Marcos Reserve) limiting casual access
en.wikipedia.org
nowboarding.com.br
. This remoteness is a shared trait, but it is diminishing: improved transportation and economic frontiers (farms, mining, tourism) are making these locations more accessible than before
theartnewspaper.com
theartnewspaper.com
. Consequently, the very isolation that once safeguarded these archaeological treasures is eroding, bringing development pressures. The common challenge now is balancing access (for research and sustainable tourism) with conservation of the sensitive sites.
In summary, officially recognized Amazon archaeological sites tend to cluster on the high, fertile ground near water and at the edges of the densest forests. They illustrate a pattern where ancient Amazonians strategically utilized the landscape – occupying well-drained spots adjacent to rivers or wetlands – to build enduring settlements and monuments. These shared geographical features underscore how environment shaped human history in the Amazon, and they aid modern researchers in predicting where other undiscovered sites might be found in the vast rainforest
