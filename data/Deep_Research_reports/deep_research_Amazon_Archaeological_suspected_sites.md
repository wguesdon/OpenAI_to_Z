## Notes for Mapping

**These coordinates define rectangular search areas. For more precise mapping, consider that archaeological sites typically cluster along:**

- River bluffs and terraces
- Interfluvial plateaus (180-300m elevation)
- Areas with terra preta (anthropogenic dark earth)
- Locations 1-10km from water sources

**Data Sources:**
- LiDAR surveys from recent archaeological expeditions
- Predictive modeling based on environmental factors
- Published archaeological research (2020-2025)
- Machine learning predictions for undiscovered sites

These boundaries encompass the highest probability areas for undiscovered archaeological sites based on current research and predictive modeling.
