Prospectus for Archaeological Discovery in the Amazon Basin: A Synthesis of Recent Scientific Findings and Geospatial AnalysisSection 1: Introduction: The End of the Pristine Myth and the Dawn of a New Amazonian Past1.1 Deconstructing the "Counterfeit Paradise"For much of the 20th century, scientific and popular conception of the Amazon Basin was dominated by the idea of a "pristine wilderness" or a "counterfeit paradise"—an environment whose seemingly lush appearance masked ecological limitations that precluded the development of large, complex human societies.1 This perspective, most famously articulated by archaeologist Betty Meggers, argued that the region's nutrient-poor soils and other environmental constraints restricted pre-Columbian populations to small, mobile, hunter-gatherer bands or limited slash-and-burn agriculturalists.2 This model of environmental determinism suggested that the Amazon was fundamentally incapable of supporting the kind of large, sedentary, and socially stratified civilizations found in Mesoamerica or the Andes.This view, however, stood in stark contrast to the accounts of the first European chroniclers who traversed the Amazon in the 16th and 17th centuries. These early explorers described a landscape teeming with people, reporting large towns, extensive road networks, and dense populations along the riverbanks—accounts that were later largely dismissed by 20th-century scholars as exaggerations or fabrications.4 The scientific consensus is now shifting to recognize the validity of these early observations. The profound demographic collapse that followed European contact, primarily due to the introduction of Old World diseases to which Indigenous populations had no immunity, is now understood to be the primary cause of this discrepancy. Epidemics may have reduced the native population by as much as 90% within the first century of contact, leading to the abandonment of cities, towns, and agricultural systems.6 Over subsequent centuries, the resilient rainforest reclaimed these human-made landscapes, effectively erasing them from view and creating the illusion of an untouched, primeval wilderness that greeted later naturalists and researchers.6 The Amazon that was long studied was not a pristine environment, but a post-apocalyptic one.1.2 The New Paradigm: Anthropogenic Landscapes and Domesticated ForestsA confluence of archaeological, paleoecological, and botanical evidence has now definitively overturned the pristine myth, replacing it with a new paradigm that recognizes much of the Amazon Basin as a mosaic of "anthropogenic landscapes" and "domesticated forests".1 This modern understanding posits that for millennia, pre-Columbian societies did not merely subsist within the forest but actively shaped and engineered it to make it more productive and habitable. This paradigm shift is foundational to any modern archaeological investigation, as it reframes the search for undiscovered sites from a quest for rare anomalies to a systematic effort to map a widespread, yet hidden, human footprint.The evidence for this extensive human modification is threefold:Amazonian Dark Earths (Terra Preta de Índio): Among the most durable indicators of long-term, sedentary occupation are vast patches of exceptionally fertile, black soil known as terra preta.11 These soils, which can be up to two meters deep, were intentionally or unintentionally created over centuries through the accumulation of organic waste, charcoal, pottery sherds, and animal bones.11 Containing significantly higher levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen and storing vast amounts of stable carbon compared to the surrounding nutrient-poor soils, terra preta sites represent hotspots of past human settlement and are a direct refutation of the theory of soil limitation.1Monumental Earthworks: Across the basin, evidence of large-scale landscape engineering is emerging in the form of earthworks. These include massive geometric enclosures (geoglyphs) for ceremonial purposes, fortified villages with surrounding ditches, complex road and causeway networks connecting settlements, and extensive systems of canals, raised fields, and fish weirs for intensive agriculture and aquaculture.2 The construction of these features required large, organized labor forces and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of ecology, hydrology, and social planning.15Managed Forest Composition: Botanical and paleoecological studies show that the composition of the forest itself is a human artifact. The areas surrounding archaeological sites consistently exhibit a "hyperdominance" of plant species useful to humans, such as the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), and cacao (Theobroma cacao).12 This pattern is not random; it is the result of millennia of active management, including the creation of forest gardens, orchards, and agroforestry systems that enriched the landscape with valuable food, construction, and medicinal resources.5The fundamental implication of this new paradigm is that the Amazon was not an obstacle to human ingenuity but a canvas for it. Consequently, the entire basin must be re-evaluated as a potential repository of archaeological sites, shifting the critical question from if complex societies existed to where their remnants are most likely to be found.1.3 Scope and Objectives of this ReportThe purpose of this report is to conduct an exhaustive investigation of recent scientific literature to identify specific areas within the Amazon rainforest that have the highest probability of containing undiscovered archaeological sites. The analysis synthesizes findings from a new generation of research, driven by technological advancements and interdisciplinary collaboration, that is rapidly rewriting the history of the region.The primary objectives are:To synthesize the evidence for large-scale, complex pre-Columbian societies across the Amazon Basin, establishing the theoretical and empirical basis for the existence of thousands of undiscovered sites.To analyze the impact of revolutionary technologies, particularly Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), in revealing the true scale and nature of ancient Amazonian settlement patterns.To detail the results of recent predictive models that use environmental and archaeological data to forecast the most probable locations of undiscovered earthworks.To provide a detailed regional analysis of the key "hotspots" of pre-Columbian development that emerge from the literature, including Southwestern Amazonia, the Upper Xingu, the Llanos de Mojos, and the Upano Valley.To culminate in a set of actionable recommendations for future exploration, supported by a consolidated database of georeferenced locations (GPS coordinates) that can serve as a direct foundation for mission planning and mapping.This document is intended to function as a strategic prospectus for targeted archaeological investigation, moving beyond academic summary to provide the data-driven intelligence necessary to guide future research and discovery in the world's largest tropical forest.21Section 2: The Technological Catalyst: LiDAR and the Unveiling of Hidden LandscapesThe recent explosion in our understanding of Amazonian prehistory is inextricably linked to the application of a single, transformative technology: Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR. For decades, the dense, triple-layered canopy of the rainforest acted as an almost impenetrable veil, obscuring the ground from aerial and satellite observation and leaving archaeologists to rely on chance discoveries in deforested areas or slow, painstaking ground surveys.4 LiDAR has effectively provided a "digital deforestation" tool, revolutionizing the field by revealing the subtle topography of ancient human works on an unprecedented scale.142.1 Principles of Airborne LiDAR in ArchaeologyLiDAR is an active remote sensing method that functions similarly to radar but uses laser light instead of radio waves.25 A LiDAR system, typically mounted on an aircraft or drone, fires millions of laser pulses per second toward the ground.4 The system's sensors measure the precise time it takes for these pulses to reflect off surfaces and return to the aircraft. Because the speed of light is a known constant, this "time of flight" data can be used to calculate the exact distance to the reflecting surface, generating a massive "point cloud" of three-dimensional coordinates.23The key to its application in forested environments is that while many laser pulses are reflected by the top layer of the canopy or leaves and branches within it, a fraction of the pulses will always penetrate the gaps in the foliage to reach the forest floor.4 Sophisticated post-processing algorithms can then filter the point cloud, digitally stripping away all the data points classified as vegetation. The result is a highly accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the bare earth, revealing micro-topographical features with a precision of centimeters.26 This process uncovers the faint but durable imprints of human activity—such as mounds, platforms, plazas, ditches, canals, and roads—that have been hidden for centuries.42.2 A Revolution in DiscoveryThe adoption of LiDAR has fundamentally altered both the pace and the scale of archaeological discovery in the Amazon. Traditional ground surveys are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and limited in scope; it could take years or even decades to map a single large site.4 In contrast, an airborne LiDAR survey can map hundreds or even thousands of square kilometers in a matter of days, providing a comprehensive overview of an entire region.4 This efficiency has been described by researchers as a "game-changer" and a "paradigm shift" in Amazonian archaeology.23Crucially, LiDAR has shifted the fundamental unit of archaeological analysis. Before its widespread use, archaeologists often found isolated features—a single mound revealed by erosion, a geoglyph uncovered by deforestation—which provided evidence of occupation but limited insight into the broader societal context.14 LiDAR, by virtue of its ability to cover vast, contiguous areas, reveals not just the sites themselves but the "connective tissue" between them. It uncovers the road systems, causeways, and canal networks that demonstrate regional integration, economic interaction, and a level of social and political organization that was previously only hypothesized. The technology has thus enabled a transition from site-based archaeology to landscape-scale archaeology, allowing researchers to see the entire settlement system as its inhabitants would have known it.2.3 Case Studies of LiDAR-Driven BreakthroughsThe transformative power of LiDAR is best illustrated through the groundbreaking discoveries it has enabled in recent years across the Amazon Basin.The Upano Valley, Ecuador: Perhaps the most spectacular recent discovery, LiDAR surveys in the Upano Valley of eastern Ecuador revealed a sprawling, 2,500-year-old urban landscape that is the oldest and largest yet found in the Amazon.24 Where previous ground surveys had identified hundreds of mounds, LiDAR analysis uncovered a dense network of over 6,000 earthen platforms, plazas, and other structures clustered into at least 15 distinct settlements.24 Most significantly, LiDAR mapped a sophisticated road network connecting these centers, with wide, straight avenues running for up to 25 kilometers.24 This discovery proved the existence of a complex, planned "garden urbanism" far earlier and on a larger scale than ever thought possible in the region.33The Llanos de Mojos, Bolivia: In the seasonally flooded savannas of Bolivia, LiDAR scans were instrumental in mapping the full complexity of the Casarabe culture (c. 500–1400 CE).4 The technology revealed a highly organized, low-density urban system with a four-tiered settlement hierarchy.38 Two massive primary centers, Cotoca and Landívar, were shown to possess monumental civic-ceremonial architecture, including conical pyramids and large U-shaped platform mounds, all protected by concentric defensive walls and moats.4 Radiating from these centers, LiDAR traced an extensive network of causeways and canals that connected them to dozens of smaller, secondary and tertiary sites, demonstrating a clear regional political and economic structure that had been invisible from the ground.38Basin-Wide Predictive Modeling: A 2023 study led by Vinicius Peripato utilized a compilation of LiDAR datasets from across 5,315 square kilometers of the Amazon.15 In this relatively small sample of the basin, the team discovered 24 previously undocumented earthworks hidden beneath the forest canopy, including fortified villages, ceremonial geoglyphs, and riverine settlements.15 This LiDAR-derived data, free from the biases of deforestation, provided a robust, unbiased sample of sites that became the foundation for the first basin-wide predictive model of earthwork locations, a critical step toward strategic, proactive discovery.15These cases demonstrate that LiDAR does not simply find more sites; it reveals a higher order of social, political, and economic organization that fundamentally changes our understanding of the Amazon's past. Any future exploration strategy must leverage this technology not just to find isolated points of interest, but to map large, contiguous landscapes to trace these ancient networks of civilization.Section 3: Predictive Frontiers: Modeling the Location of Undiscovered Amazonian SocietiesThe convergence of large archaeological datasets and advanced computational methods has opened a new frontier in Amazonian archaeology: predictive modeling. By systematically analyzing the environmental characteristics of known settlement locations, researchers can now build statistical models that forecast the probability of finding undiscovered sites across the entire 6.7 million km² basin. This approach represents a crucial shift from reactive discovery, which often relies on chance or deforestation, to a proactive, data-driven strategy for exploration that can guide the efficient allocation of expensive resources like LiDAR surveys.3.1 The Peripato et al. (2023) ModelA landmark 2023 study published in Science by Vinicius Peripato and a large international team presents the most comprehensive predictive model for pre-Columbian earthworks to date.15 The study's methodology provides a blueprint for future predictive work. The researchers first compiled a comprehensive database of 960 existing, georeferenced archaeological sites known to feature earthworks (such as ring ditches, geoglyphs, and mounds). They augmented this with 24 new earthworks discovered through their own analysis of LiDAR data covering 0.08% of the Amazon basin.15Using this combined dataset, they employed a sophisticated statistical technique known as an Inhomogeneous Poisson Process (IPP) model. This model correlates the locations of known sites with a suite of over 40 environmental variables, including bioclimatic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation), edaphic characteristics (soil type and fertility), and topographic features (e.g., elevation, slope, distance to water).15 By identifying the specific environmental conditions that pre-Columbian earth-building societies preferred, the model can then extrapolate across the entire basin to predict the probability of finding similar sites in un-surveyed areas, even those hidden beneath dense, intact forest. This approach overcomes the historical bias of discoveries being concentrated in deforested zones, providing a more accurate picture of potential settlement patterns.153.2 Key Prediction: The Southwestern Amazonian HotspotThe primary and most significant finding of the Peripato et al. model is that the probability of finding undiscovered earthworks is not evenly distributed across the Amazon. Instead, it is overwhelmingly concentrated in the southwestern portion of the basin.15 This region, encompassing the Brazilian state of Acre, the state of Rondônia, southern Amazonas state, northern Bolivia, and southeastern Peru, emerges as a clear "hotspot" for pre-Columbian earth-building societies. This finding corroborates previous studies that had identified this area as a center for geoglyph construction and other forms of landscape modification.15 The model provides robust, basin-wide statistical support for prioritizing this vast region for future archaeological investigation.3.3 Quantifying the UnknownThe model's predictions regarding the sheer number of undiscovered sites are staggering and underscore the transformative potential of future research. With 95% probability, the model estimates that between 10,272 and 23,648 pre-Columbian earthworks remain hidden throughout Amazonia, with an average prediction of 16,187 sites.15 This implies that the currently documented earthworks represent a mere 4% to 9% of the total that once existed. In other words, as much as 96% of the Amazon's rich history of landscape engineering remains to be discovered.4 These figures dramatically reframe the Amazon not as a region with a few isolated archaeological curiosities, but as a landscape rich with the heritage of countless communities, the vast majority of which are still unknown to science.3.4 The Acre High-Probability RectangleThe Peripato et al. study provides an even more specific target for exploration. The analysis indicates that nearly all of the 1-km² cells with the highest probability of containing an earthwork (a predicted probability of ≥25%) fall within a single, contiguous 94,713-km² rectangle.15 This high-probability zone overlays a substantial portion of the Brazilian state of Acre and likely extends into neighboring regions of Bolivia and Peru. This defined area represents the single most promising target for large-scale, discovery-oriented LiDAR surveys in the entire Amazon. It is critical to note, however, that the publicly available versions of the research paper and its associated articles do not contain the specific bounding box coordinates (latitude and longitude) for this rectangle.46 A primary and immediate objective for any research program intending to act on these findings must be to obtain the supplementary materials associated with the Peripato et al. (2023) Science publication to precisely define this priority search area.3.5 Corroborating Models and Associated IndicatorsThe robustness of the earthwork prediction model is strengthened by its correlation with other lines of evidence. Other modeling efforts, focused specifically on the distribution of terra preta soils, have also identified non-random patterns of settlement. These models show that terra preta sites are most likely to be found along the bluffs of major rivers in Central and Eastern Amazonia, a different but equally defined pattern that complements the earthwork model.1Furthermore, the Peripato et al. model found a statistically significant association between the probability of an earthwork's presence and the occurrence of 53 domesticated or managed tree species, including the Brazil nut and cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum).15 This finding reinforces the deep connection between settlement, landscape engineering, and long-term forest management. It suggests that pre-Columbian societies created integrated, productive landscapes where their settlements, earthworks, and agroforestry systems were all part of a single, cohesive whole. The presence of these managed forests can thus serve as another potential proxy for locating undiscovered sites. Together, these converging lines of evidence from multiple modeling approaches provide a powerful, data-driven roadmap for strategically targeting the next wave of archaeological exploration in the Amazon.Section 4: Regional Analysis of High-Probability Zones for Archaeological InvestigationThe new paradigm in Amazonian archaeology reveals not a single, monolithic culture but a mosaic of diverse and sophisticated societies, each with unique adaptations to their specific environmental and social contexts. Recent discoveries, particularly those driven by LiDAR, have brought several key regions into sharp focus as epicenters of pre-Columbian complexity. An analysis of these zones, guided by the predictive models, provides a detailed prospectus for where future discoveries are most likely to be made.Table 1: Summary of Key Pre-Columbian Archaeological Regions in AmazoniaRegion/CultureCountryKey Time PeriodCharacteristic Archaeological FeaturesDominant Subsistence StrategyKey Environmental SettingPrimary ReferencesAcre GeoglyphsBrazil, Boliviac. 2000–650 BP (some earlier)Geometric earthworks (circles, squares), ceremonial/social sites, interconnecting roads.Unclear; likely mixed foraging and small-scale cultivation within managed forests.Upland terra firme (interfluvial) forests, often bamboo-dominated, on fertile soils.20Upper Xingu "Garden Cities"Brazilc. 1200–1600 CEPlanned plaza villages, fortified settlements, wide road networks, fish weirs, causeways.Intensive manioc cultivation, managed fisheries (aquaculture), agroforestry.Headwaters region with a mix of upland forests and floodplains.6Llanos de Mojos (Casarabe Culture)Boliviac. 500–1400 CEFour-tiered settlement hierarchy, monumental mounds, conical pyramids, concentric moats, extensive causeways and canals.Intensive, year-round maize monoculture enabled by hydraulic engineering.Seasonally flooded savanna-forest mosaic with fertile fluvial sediments.2Upano Valley UrbanismEcuadorc. 500 BCE–600 CEDense urban network of >6,000 earthen platforms, plazas, and a grid-like road system.Agrarian society cultivating maize, manioc, beans, sweet potato on terraces.Andean foothills with fertile volcanic soil, managed with drainage canals.24Loreto DepartmentPeruVariousPrimarily ceramic sites, some with anthropogenic soils; human-made islands in flooded zones.Varies; likely riverine-focused with fishing and floodplain agriculture.Western Amazonian lowlands with highly active, meandering rivers.21Terra Preta FormationsBasin-wide (esp. Central/Eastern)c. 500–2500 BPAnthropogenic dark earths (ADEs), highly fertile soils rich in carbon and artifacts.Diverse; associated with long-term sedentary agriculture and resource processing.Primarily high bluffs and terraces along major rivers.14.1 The Geoglyph Heartland: Acre State, Brazil, and the Southwestern Amazonian PeripheryThe southwestern Amazon, particularly the Brazilian state of Acre and adjacent areas of northern Bolivia and southern Amazonas, is defined by the presence of hundreds of monumental geometric earthworks known as geoglyphs.47 These structures, which consist of ditches up to 11 meters wide and 4 meters deep forming precise circles, squares, and other complex shapes, represent a unique and widespread form of pre-Columbian landscape modification.32 This region aligns perfectly with the primary "hotspot" identified by the Peripato et al. (2023) predictive model, marking it as an area of exceptionally high potential for new discoveries.15The function of these geoglyphs appears to be primarily ceremonial or social. Excavations have revealed a near-total absence of domestic artifacts or habitation debris within the enclosures, suggesting they were kept ritually "clean" and served as periodic gathering places rather than permanent villages.20 Their construction, dating from as early as 3500 BP but peaking between 2000 and 650 BP, demonstrates a long-standing and shared ideological tradition across a vast territory.20 The builders are thought to have been a network of local, politically autonomous groups, possibly linked to the Arawak or Takana linguistic families, who shared a common cosmology expressed through this monumental architecture.20 The landscape was highly structured, with evidence of ancient roads connecting geoglyphs to one another and to local water sources, forming a terrestrial-fluvial network for ritual movement and social integration.48Critically, these societies thrived not in the resource-rich floodplains but in the upland terra firme forests, a setting long considered marginal.20 Paleoecological research has shown that the geoglyphs were not built by clear-cutting the forest. Instead, they were constructed within small, temporary clearings inside an already human-managed landscape. For at least 6,000 years, the region was dominated by bamboo forests, but the geoglyph-builders actively managed these forests for millennia, encouraging the growth of useful species like palms.20 This demonstrates a sophisticated system of agroforestry and sustainable land use that challenges previous notions of pre-Columbian agriculture.While over 450 geoglyphs have been identified, mostly through deforestation since the 1970s, this is considered to be only a small fraction of the total.32 The predictive models suggest thousands more lie hidden under the remaining forest canopy. The Tequinho site complex in Acre, for which specific coordinates are available, serves as a concrete example of this phenomenon. It is a major node with multiple structures and associated roads radiating outwards, linking it to the broader landscape and the Iquiri River.48 The coordinates for this complex provide a tangible starting point for mapping and exploring this high-priority region.4.2 The Garden Cities of the Upper Xingu Basin, BrazilIn the headwaters region of the Xingu River in Mato Grosso, Brazil, archaeologists have uncovered a distinct form of pre-Columbian settlement pattern described as "galactic" or decentralized urbanism.6 Flourishing between approximately 1200 and 1600 CE, this society was organized into clusters of interconnected settlements that formed small, independent polities.50 These are not cities in the centralized, Mesopotamian sense, but rather "garden cities" that integrated settlement, agriculture, and forest management into a sustainable whole.6The archaeological signature of the Upper Xingu is a network of large, pre-planned villages, often fortified with ditches and palisades, featuring a central circular plaza.9 These primary settlements were linked to smaller satellite villages by a remarkable network of wide, straight roads, engineered with curbs and oriented cardinally, indicating a high degree of regional planning.6 The landscape surrounding these settlements was heavily modified, with evidence of extensive agricultural fields, causeways crossing wetlands, and the construction of weirs and ponds for intensive fish farming.6 The long-term occupation also led to the formation of rich terra preta soils, further enhancing agricultural productivity.49The subsistence strategy of these societies was highly sophisticated and diverse, based on the intensive cultivation of manioc (cassava) as a staple crop, supplemented by a variety of other plants and expert management of aquatic resources.57 Fish farming, in particular, provided a stable and abundant source of protein, overcoming one of the key environmental limitations thought to have constrained Amazonian populations.6Socially, the region was organized as a "peer polity," a system of distinct but interacting political entities.50 Despite linguistic diversity (with Arawak, Carib, and Tupi speakers), the groups shared a common cultural framework, maintaining peace through a complex network of specialized trade, intermarriage, and shared inter-village rituals.55 This region is notable for its remarkable cultural continuity, with the descendants of these pre-Columbian societies, such as the Kuikuro people, still inhabiting the area today and preserving many of the ancient traditions.62 While key sites like the Kuhikugu complex (Site X11) have been studied, the full extent of the road networks and the hypothesized locations of other settlement clusters remain largely unmapped under the forest.50 The coordinates for Kuhikugu (12°33′30″S, 53°6′40″W) serve as a known central node from which future LiDAR surveys could radiate to trace these ancient connections.634.3 Low-Density Urbanism in the Llanos de Mojos, Bolivia: The Casarabe CultureThe seasonally flooded savanna-forest mosaic of the Llanos de Mojos in Beni Department, Bolivia, was home to one of the most architecturally complex societies yet discovered in the Amazon: the Casarabe culture, which flourished from approximately 500 to 1400 CE.2 Recent LiDAR surveys have revealed that this culture developed a unique form of low-density agrarian urbanism, characterized by a four-tiered settlement hierarchy that organized the landscape over an area of at least 4,500 km².38At the apex of this hierarchy are two massive primary centers, Cotoca and Landívar, which were previously known but whose true scale was unimaginable before LiDAR.4 These sites feature monumental civic-ceremonial architecture, including large earthen platforms, U-shaped structures, and impressive conical pyramids reaching heights of 22 meters.4 The centers were protected by a series of ranked, concentric polygonal moats and earthen walls, indicating a need for defense and controlled access.38 Radiating out from these major centers is an extensive network of straight, raised causeways and canals that stretch for kilometers, connecting them to dozens of smaller secondary and tertiary settlements, which also feature platform mounds.2 This integrated system demonstrates a high degree of social stratification and centralized planning, capable of mobilizing the enormous amount of labor required for such constructions.52The Casarabe culture's success was predicated on its mastery of landscape engineering to overcome the region's formidable environmental challenges. The Llanos de Mojos experiences extreme seasonal variation, with widespread flooding in the wet season and drought in the dry season.65 The Casarabe people settled on elevated natural levees formed by ancient river deposits, which provided both higher ground and access to more fertile soils.2 From these settlements, they constructed a vast hydraulic network of canals for drainage during floods and reservoirs for water storage during droughts.2 This system allowed for a highly productive and unique subsistence strategy: intensive, year-round maize monoculture.51 This reliance on a grain staple, rather than the more common manioc, supported a large, dense population, with estimates for the region ranging from 10,000 to over 100,000 people.52 Significantly, their agricultural activities were focused on the savannas, while they actively preserved the limited forest islands for other resources like firewood, construction materials, and medicinal plants.51The potential for new discoveries in this region is immense. While LiDAR has mapped the core areas of Cotoca and Landívar, the full extent of the 4,500 km² Casarabe territory is far from surveyed.28 Following the radiating causeways from known centers is a clear and promising strategy for locating and mapping the hundreds of smaller settlements that completed this complex urban system. Although specific GPS coordinates for the main centers are not available in the reviewed materials, numerous high-resolution LiDAR maps and 3D animations have been published by the research teams of Heiko Prümers and Carla Jaimes Betancourt.39 Acquiring the raw LiDAR data from these projects would enable the generation of precise coordinates for thousands of individual archaeological features.4.4 The Ancient Urban Network of the Upano Valley, EcuadorIn the Upano Valley, on the eastern Andean foothills of Ecuador, recent LiDAR surveys have unveiled what is currently understood to be the oldest and most extensive urban network in the entire Amazon Basin.24 The settlements, attributed to the Kilamope and Upano cultures, were occupied for over a millennium, beginning around 500 BCE and lasting until 300-600 CE.33 This early date makes the Upano society more than 1,000 years older than other known complex societies in the Amazon, such as those in the Llanos de Mojos or the Upper Xingu, completely reshaping the timeline of Amazonian urbanism.The archaeological signature of the Upano Valley is one of dense, planned urbanism. LiDAR scans of a 300 km² area revealed an extraordinary network of over 6,000 earthen platforms, which served as the foundations for residential and ceremonial buildings.23 These platforms, typically rectangular and measuring around 20 by 10 meters, were arranged in planned clusters around central plazas.34 The entire landscape was interconnected by a strikingly sophisticated road system. Wide, straight roads, some up to 10 meters across and excavated several meters deep, ran for as far as 25 kilometers, linking at least 15 distinct settlements.24 The grid-like and right-angled nature of this network indicates a high level of engineering and central planning that defies the natural topography.24This urban civilization was supported by an intensive agricultural system. The inhabitants took advantage of the region's fertile volcanic soil, a product of the nearby Sangay volcano, and engineered the landscape to manage the heavy Andean rainfall.33 LiDAR data shows extensive agricultural fields bounded by drainage ditches and canals, as well as hillside terraces for cultivating crops like maize, manioc, beans, and sweet potato.35 The cultural importance of maize is further suggested by the discovery of large ceramic jugs containing the residue of chicha, a traditional fermented maize beer.37The scale of this urban landscape implies a large and highly organized society. While the exact political structure remains unknown, the ability to mobilize labor for the construction of thousands of platforms and a regional road network points to a complex, stratified social system.24 Population estimates for the surveyed area at its peak vary widely, from a conservative 10,000–15,000 people to upwards of 100,000.24 The potential for further discovery is extremely high, as the road networks have been observed to extend beyond the boundaries of the initial 300 km² LiDAR survey, indicating that the full urban system is even larger than currently documented.34 The general coordinates for the settlement cluster (2.131751°S, 78.105376°W) provide a central point from which to plan a broader search area to map the true extent of this ancient Amazonian megalopolis.344.5 The Western Frontier: Reassessing the Peruvian Amazon (Loreto)For many years, the western Amazon, particularly the vast Loreto Department of Peru, was considered archaeologically impoverished and sparsely populated, an assumption based on the region's highly dynamic river systems and a lack of large, visible earthworks.22 However, a recent comprehensive review of unpublished archival materials has radically challenged this notion. Researchers have compiled a database of 415 previously undocumented archaeological sites in Loreto alone, demonstrating that the region was far from empty and contains a rich, though less monumental, record of pre-Columbian occupation.21The archaeological signatures in this region are more subtle than the massive earthworks found elsewhere. They consist primarily of ceramic scatters, indicating former settlement sites, and patches of anthropogenic soils.21 One particularly remarkable discovery in the middle Solimões region, along the upper Amazon River, revealed seven large ceramic funeral urns buried on a human-made island.53 These artificial islands were constructed by ancestral Indigenous peoples to elevate their communities above seasonal floodwaters, showcasing a unique and ingenious adaptation to the challenging riverine environment.53 The urns themselves, some containing human bones and others offerings of seeds and animal remains, point to complex mortuary rituals and symbolic beliefs about the body and afterlife.53The environmental context of the Peruvian Amazon is dominated by some of the world's most active meandering rivers. While this fluvial dynamism can destroy sites through erosion, it also means that long-term settlements would have been strategically located on the most stable landforms, such as high bluffs and older, elevated river terraces.22 Identifying these specific geomorphological features is therefore a key strategy for locating undiscovered sites.The potential for discovery in Loreto is now understood to be high. The database of 415 sites provides a dense and unprecedented foundation for future research. It allows for the application of predictive modeling on a regional scale, using the locations of these known sites to identify patterns in settlement choice and forecast where other, similar sites are likely to be found.21 The most critical asset for any investigation in the Western Amazon is the georeferenced database itself. The data, published by Kalliola et al. and stored in the figshare repository (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.16750639), contains the longitude and latitude for each of the 415 sites and is an essential tool for any future exploration in this redefined frontier.214.6 Other Indicators: Terra Preta and Riverine Settlements in Central and Eastern AmazoniaBeyond the monumental earthworks concentrated in the southwest, another key indicator of significant pre-Columbian settlement is the presence of Amazonian Dark Earths, or terra preta.11 These anthropogenic soils are a direct and durable signature of long-term, sedentary human occupation, created over centuries by the deposition of organic refuse, charcoal, and pottery.1 Their exceptional fertility, which can support continuous agriculture in a way that typical Amazonian soils cannot, allowed for the sustenance of large and stable populations.13The distribution of terra preta is not random, and predictive models have been developed to map its likely extent across the basin.1 These models, which use environmental variables such as terrain, hydrology, and soil characteristics, indicate that terra preta sites are most frequently found in Central and Eastern Amazonia, particularly on the high bluffs and stable terraces overlooking major rivers like the Amazon, Negro, and Tapajós.1 While climate is a factor, local topography and proximity to major waterways appear to be the most important predictors of their location.1 This pattern suggests that the major river highways were corridors for dense and permanent settlement.The potential for discovering new terra preta sites remains significant. While many of the largest and most famous sites (e.g., near Santarém and on Marajó Island) are well-known, predictive models estimate that these soils may cover as much as 154,063 km², or 3.2% of the Amazon forest.1 This implies that thousands of smaller, unrecorded sites likely exist. Locating these sites requires a different strategy than searching for large earthworks. Recent research suggests that the unique nutrient composition of terra preta soils influences the overlying forest, creating a distinct spectral signature—a difference in how the canopy reflects light—that may be detectable from satellite imagery.12 Future exploration in Central and Eastern Amazonia should therefore focus on combining soil probability models with advanced remote sensing techniques to identify these subtle vegetation anomalies, which can then be targeted for on-the-ground verification.Section 5: Synthesis and Actionable Recommendations for Future ExplorationThe convergence of predictive modeling, revolutionary LiDAR technology, and decades of archaeological fieldwork has created an unprecedented opportunity to systematically uncover the lost history of the Amazon Basin. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the region was not a pristine wilderness but a heavily populated and engineered landscape, the vast majority of which remains hidden beneath the forest canopy. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the recent scientific literature, this report proposes a dual-pronged strategy for future exploration, combining broad, discovery-oriented surveys in the highest-probability zones with targeted, network-tracing surveys to map the full extent of known urban systems.5.1 Primary Area of Investigation: The Southwestern Amazonian Earth-Builder Interaction SphereThe single highest priority for new, large-scale archaeological discovery lies in the southwestern portion of the Amazon Basin. This conclusion is strongly supported by multiple, converging lines of evidence. The basin-wide predictive model by Peripato et al. (2023) identifies this region as the undisputed hotspot for undiscovered earthworks, with a specific 94,713-km² rectangle in the state of Acre containing the highest concentration of probable sites.15 This statistical prediction is empirically grounded in the known distribution of hundreds of monumental geoglyphs in Acre and the complex mound and causeway systems of the Casarabe culture in the adjacent Llanos de Mojos of Bolivia.38These are not isolated phenomena but are likely part of a contiguous or interacting cultural sphere characterized by a shared tradition of large-scale landscape modification. The forested regions that lie between and around these known concentrations are therefore the most fertile ground for finding previously unknown settlement types and understanding the connections between these complex societies.Recommendation:A large-scale, systematic LiDAR survey should be initiated, focusing on the 94,713-km² high-probability rectangle identified in the Peripato et al. (2023) study.Immediate Action: The first and most critical step is to acquire the supplementary research data from the aforementioned Science paper to obtain the precise bounding box coordinates of this high-probability rectangle.Survey Objective: The survey should aim not only to identify new geoglyphs, mounds, and settlements but also to map the landscape features between them, specifically searching for ancient roads, canals, or other evidence of interconnection. This will be crucial for determining whether the geoglyph-building societies of Acre and the urban cultures of the Llanos de Mojos were part of a broader regional system.5.2 Secondary Areas of Investigation: Mapping the Full Extent of Known Urban NetworksWhile the southwestern Amazon offers the greatest potential for discovering entirely new settlement patterns, the recent LiDAR-driven discoveries in the Upano Valley, Llanos de Mojos, and Upper Xingu have revealed the cores of what are clearly much larger urban and political systems. In each of these cases, the road and causeway networks have been observed extending beyond the boundaries of the initial surveys, providing clear vectors for follow-up investigation. Mapping the full extent of these networks is a critical secondary priority, as it will provide a complete picture of the scale and organization of the most complex societies known in the Amazon to date.Recommendations:Three targeted, expanding LiDAR surveys should be conducted, radiating from the known centers of complexity:Upano Valley, Ecuador: The initial 300 km² survey revealed a dense urban core. The next phase should consist of flying survey transects that radiate outwards from this core, systematically following the major road networks to their termination points. The objective is to map the full geographic extent of this ancient megalopolis and identify its peripheral settlements and agricultural support systems.Llanos de Mojos, Bolivia: The LiDAR mapping of the Cotoca and Landívar centers has confirmed a four-tiered settlement hierarchy. Future surveys should expand from these primary centers, following the extensive causeway systems to locate and map the hundreds of smaller, un-surveyed sites that constituted the lower tiers of the Casarabe political system. The goal is to map the entirety of the estimated 4,500 km² Casarabe culture area to understand its complete political and economic geography.Upper Xingu Basin, Brazil: Archaeological maps of this region show known "garden city" clusters alongside numerous hypothetical polities.50 Targeted LiDAR surveys should be conducted in the forested areas between the known clusters, following the projected paths of the ancient road networks. This will serve to confirm the existence and precise location of these hypothetical settlements and map the transportation and communication corridors that integrated the entire regional peer polity.5.3 Geospatial Data for Mission PlanningThe successful planning and execution of the recommended surveys require a foundational geospatial dataset. The following table consolidates the specific GPS coordinates identified in the scientific literature. These data points can be directly imported into Geographic Information System (GIS) software (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS) to serve as anchors for defining survey areas, planning flight paths, and visualizing the relationship between known sites and the high-probability zones identified in this report. This table represents the operational starting point for turning this strategic analysis into a program of active exploration.Table 2: Consolidated Geospatial Database of Amazonian Archaeological SitesSite_IDSite_NameLatitudeLongitudeRegionCountrySite_TypeCertainty/NotesAC-TQN-01Tequinho (Road E1)-9.897022-67.423897AcreBrazilGeoglyph Complex / RoadHigh.
