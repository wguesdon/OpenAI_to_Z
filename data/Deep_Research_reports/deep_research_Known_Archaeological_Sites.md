Known Archaeological Sites in the Amazon Rainforest
Original Question: "The user is requesting a list of known archaeological sites in the Amazon Rainforest, including: sites from all cultures and time periods (pre-Columbian, colonial, etc.), both well-documented and lesser-known or recently discovered, across the entire Amazon Basin (Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and other countries). Each site should include name, geographic coordinates, country, and brief context/description." Archaeological Sites (with Coordinates, Country, and Descriptions): Upano Valley Sites (2.1317°S, 78.1054°W) – Ecuador (Morona-Santiago) – A cluster of 15 ancient settlements in the Upano River Valley of eastern Ecuador, recently revealed by LiDAR. These “lost cities” date back to c. 500 BC, making them the earliest known complex society in Amazonia
en.wikipedia.org
. The settlements feature earthen platform mounds, dug roadways, and extensive agriculture, and were inhabited by the Upano/Kilamope culture until ~AD 300-600

. Jacó Sá Geoglyph Site (9°57′38″S, 67°29′51″W) – Brazil (Acre) – A pre-Columbian geometric earthwork enclosure in Acre State. One of over 450 massive geoglyphs discovered in deforested southwestern Amazon, Jacó Sá consists of large square ditches with a circular moat inside

. Radiocarbon dating shows these earthworks (built by unknown Amazonian peoples) were constructed ~2,000 years ago, indicating ancient land use and forest clearing for agriculture in the region

. Monte de Teso dos Bichos (Camutins) (0.983°S, 49.583°W) – Brazil (Marajó Island, Pará) – A pre-Columbian mound complex on Marajó Island, at the Amazon’s mouth. The Marajoara culture (AD 400–1300) built dozens of raised earthen mounds (“tesos”) here to live above seasonal floods
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Teso dos Bichos (part of the Camutins site) is a 2.5 ha artificial mound, one of ~30 in the area
en.wikipedia.org
. Marajoara society was highly organized, renowned for elaborate polychrome pottery and large-scale fish-farming and agriculture on these mounds
en.wikipedia.org
. Caverna da Pedra Pintada (1.996°S, 54.071°W) – Brazil (Monte Alegre, Pará) – Also called “Painted Rock Cave,” this cave site in the Amazon Basin contains rock art and early human remains. Excavations by Anna Roosevelt found evidence of human habitation ~11,200 years ago
en.wikipedia.org
, making it one of the oldest sites in Amazonia. Dozens of pictographs adorn the cave walls, and Paleoindian stone tools and plant remains show that an independent early culture thrived here contemporaneous with North American Paleoindians
en.wikipedia.org
. The cave helped prove that humans occupied the Amazon much earlier than previously thought. Taperinha Shell Midden (2.443°S, 54.280°W) – Brazil (Santarém, Pará) – An ancient shell mound on a terra firme bluff near the Amazon River. Taperinha is famous for yielding some of the earliest ceramics in the Americas. The site’s midden, ~4 m high, has layers of shells, charcoal, hearths, and pottery. Sherds from Taperinha have been radiocarbon-dated to 8000–7000 years ago (c. 6000–5000 BC)
en.wikipedia.org
, indicating that a community of fisher-hunter-gatherers in the Lower Amazon was making pottery by the early Holocene. This “Pottery Archaic” tradition at Taperinha predates the next oldest ceramics in South America by at least a millennium
en.wikipedia.org
. Casarabe Culture Settlements (Llanos de Mojos) (~14.8°S, 64.5°W) – Bolivia (Beni Department) – A network of pre-Hispanic urban villages with monumental earthworks in the seasonally flooded Bolivian Amazon. Recent LiDAR surveys revealed 26 settlement sites (including two large urban centers named Cotoca and Landívar) built by the Casarabe culture (AD 500–1400)
sci.news
. These sites feature huge platform mounds, 20-m tall conical pyramids, straight raised causeways connecting settlements, reservoirs, and defensive moats

. The largest site (Landívar) spans 315 ha with concentric polygonal enclosures
the-past.com
. This discovery overturns the idea of an untouched Amazon – it was home to a low-density urban society practicing intensive agriculture and water management

. Serranía de Chiribiquete (1.3275°N, 72.7614°W) – Colombia (Caquetá/Guaviare) – A massive table-top mountain (tepui) region in the central Colombian Amazon, famed for its ancient rock art. Chiribiquete National Park (“The Maloca of the Jaguar”) covers 2.7 million ha of rainforest and tepuis, and is UNESCO-listed for both natural and cultural value
en.wikipedia.org
. Dozens of rock shelters on the sheer tepui cliffs house tens of thousands of paintings, depicting jaguars, humans, and sacred rituals. Some of these pictographs are thought to date back many millennia (possibly to the late Pleistocene) and are sacred to indigenous peoples
phys.org
. (Due to its ecological and cultural sensitivity, the park is largely off-limits to visitors.) Cerro Azul (Serranía La Lindosa) (2.5297°N, 72.8658°W) – Colombia (Guaviare) – A sandstone hill in the Guaviare region with one of the world’s most extensive rock art assemblages. In 2020, researchers publicized the “Sistine Chapel of the Ancients” here: an 8-mile stretch of cliffs covered in vividly painted images of Ice Age megafauna, reptiles, birds, and humans
apollo-magazine.com
. The art, found at sites like Cerro Azul, Raudal Nuevo Tolima, etc., may be up to 12,500 years old
apollo-magazine.com
, making it among the earliest evidence of humans in the Amazon. The paintings (likely made by Paleoindigenous foragers) include now-extinct giant sloths and mastodons, suggesting Pleistocene age

. Kuélap Fortress (6°25′35″S, 77°55′38″W) – Peru (Amazonas Region) – A monumental walled citadel of the Chachapoya culture, perched at 3000 m in the cloud forests above the Utcubamba Valley. Kuélap was built ca. AD 500–800 and occupied until the 16th century
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. It consists of massive limestone defensive walls (up to 20 m high) enclosing a mountaintop urban center ~600 m long. Inside are hundreds of circular stone dwellings and ceremonial structures, including “El Tintero” (a curved temple) and decorated friezes typical of Chachapoya art. Sometimes called the “Machu Picchu of the north,” Kuélap illustrates an advanced pre-Inca society thriving on the Amazon-Andes fringe
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Gran Pajatén (7.649°S, 77.418°W) – Peru (San Martín/La Libertad) – A remote mountaintop ruin deep in the Andean-Amazon cloud forest, attributed to the Chachapoyas (or a predecessor culture). Gran Pajatén, founded around 200 BC
en.wikipedia.org
, comprises at least 26 circular stone buildings decorated with slate mosaic friezes (geometric and human figures) on their walls. The site sits on a 2,850 m ridge within Río Abiseo National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage site)
en.wikipedia.org
. Due to its isolation and fragility, it is off-limits to tourism. Gran Pajatén’s discovery in the 1960s expanded knowledge of Amazonian highland civilizations and their integration with the surrounding rainforest environment
en.wikipedia.org
. Fort Príncipe da Beira (12°25′40″S, 64°25′22″W) – Brazil (Rondônia) – An 18th-century colonial fortress and town on the Guaporé River, in the southwestern Amazon. Built in 1775 by the Portuguese, this stone star-fort guarded Brazil’s frontier (opposite Spanish Bolivia). A significant colonial city grew around the fort, fueled by mining and plantation agriculture with enslaved labor
jpost.com
. The site was abandoned in the XIX century and overgrown by jungle. It was known from old maps, but in 2024 archaeologists used LiDAR to rediscover the lost town layout hidden under the forest
jpost.com
jpost.com
. Today, the fort’s ruins – massive stone walls and bastions – still stand, marking one of the Amazon’s largest colonial-era archaeological sites. References: 1. Coomes, O. et al. “Geolocation of unpublished archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon.” Scientific Data 8, 290 (2021).
