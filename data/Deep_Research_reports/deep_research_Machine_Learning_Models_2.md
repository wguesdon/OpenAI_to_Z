 # Machine Learning Models Reveal Hidden Archaeology Beneath the Amazon Canopy

Question: Identify recent (past 5 years) machine learning models that have been successfully used to detect archaeological features hidden beneath the forest canopy in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. Include models that utilize any type of data source (e.g., LiDAR, satellite imagery, hyperspectral data) and describe their methods and effectiveness. Highlight both academic and applied use cases where these models have contributed to new archaeological findings or enhanced survey accuracy.

## Introduction
Dense tropical forests like the Brazilian Amazon long concealed traces of ancient civilizations. In the past five years, archaeologists have increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) techniques combined with advanced remote sensing to “see” through the canopy and detect hidden archaeological features. Below, we discuss several ML-powered approaches – using LiDAR, satellite multispectral/hyperspectral data, and environmental predictors – that have proven effective in locating ancient earthworks, settlements, and other features under the Amazon’s forest cover. We also highlight how these models have led to new discoveries and improved survey accuracy in both academic research and applied fieldwork.

## LiDAR and Deep Learning for Feature Detection
LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has revolutionized Amazon archaeology by producing detailed 3D maps of ground terrain under dense vegetation. Machine learning models, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are being trained to automatically recognize the subtle shapes of archaeological features in LiDAR-derived elevation data. Recent research shows that CNN-based object detection can identify man-made structures (like mounds, ditches, or geometric earthworks) in LiDAR datasets with high accuracy, greatly speeding up what was once a manual process

. For instance, Fiorucci et al. (2022) demonstrated a deep learning framework that achieved strong detection performance on LiDAR data by evaluating novel accuracy metrics for archaeological objects

. Such models learn to spot patterns of elevation – e.g. the regular geometric outlines of prehistoric enclosures or the linear embankments of causeways – even when obscured by canopy.

In practice, LiDAR-based ML has enabled broad-area “scanning” of the forest floor for hidden sites. A notable applied use case occurred in Acre state (western Brazil), where researchers used helicopter-mounted LiDAR to survey remote jungle. The LiDAR revealed 25 circular villages (with mounded plazas) and 11 rectangular villages dating to 1300–1700 CE that were invisible in conventional satellite images

. The LiDAR data allowed the team to digitally “deforest” the canopy and automatically highlight circular moats, roads, and mound arrangements. As lead author José Iriarte noted, “LiDAR has allowed us to detect these villages and their features such as roads, which wasn’t possible before because most are not visible within the best satellite data available.”

This discovery, published in 2020, revealed a whole network of prehistoric communities—findings only possible through LiDAR analytics that discerned anthropogenic forms under heavy vegetation. Similarly, in the adjacent Bolivian Amazon, LiDAR surveys in 2022 uncovered large pre-Columbian urban sites with interconnected causeways and reservoirs

, underscoring LiDAR’s power in dense forests. Although those LiDAR discoveries involved significant expert interpretation, emerging ML tools are poised to take on more of the detection work automatically. By training on known Amazonian earthworks, random forest classifiers and CNNs can flag potential archaeological relief “anomalies” in huge LiDAR datasets far faster than human eyes, focusing archaeologists’ attention on high-probability targets

. This fusion of LiDAR and ML has dramatically enhanced survey efficiency and led to unprecedented finds under the Amazon canopy.

## Satellite and Hyperspectral Image Models
Beyond LiDAR, researchers have explored satellite imagery (including hyperspectral data) with ML to infer buried archaeological sites from subtle vegetation and soil signals. A key example is detecting Amazonian Dark Earth (terra preta) sites – fertile ancient settlement soils – via spectral signatures in the forest canopy. Vegetation growing over these anthropogenic soils shows distinct reflectance patterns due to differences in nutrients and species composition. Recent work (building on earlier proofs of concept) has used satellite hyperspectral sensors to train ML classifiers that distinguish terra preta zones from normal soils by their canopy reflectance in specific wavebands

. In one study, scientists analyzed NASA’s Hyperion satellite spectra and found that five particular wavelengths were diagnostic of terra preta; a machine learning approach leveraging these spectral features could successfully flag known “black earth” sites under unbroken forest
wired.com
. The underlying reason is that “a different set of species…grow on those super-enriched soils” compared to typical poor soils, and this difference can be mapped to target archaeological sites
wired.com
. In essence, the ML model learns the spectral fingerprint of human-altered soil via the proxy of canopy vegetation health and composition. Although this hyperspectral approach was initially tested on known sites, researchers are now applying it to locate previously unknown terra preta patches. If confirmed with newer satellite missions, such models could guide archaeologists to hidden village locations remotely

.

Even using regular multispectral satellite imagery, AI models have shown promise in detecting archaeological patterning. For instance, deep learning has been applied to high-resolution aerial and satellite photos to recognize geometric shapes of earthworks or mounds in partially deforested areas. In the Amazon, many geoglyph earthworks (large geometric clearings outlined by ditches) were first noticed on Google Earth by human-eye scanning. Now, algorithms can be trained on those examples to scan vast imagery for similar geometric anomalies. TechnoLynx, for example, reported developing an AI model that combined Sentinel-2 satellite data and LiDAR inputs to pinpoint ancient settlement traces in the Amazon, successfully identifying previously unknown mound clusters and ceremonial centers

. Such applications highlight that ML can fuse multiple data sources – optical imagery for broad coverage and LiDAR for elevation detail – to overcome the challenges of dense canopy. Additionally, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which penetrates some vegetation, are being explored with ML to detect subtle elevation changes (e.g. raised fields or causeways) even under tree cover. While still in experimental stages, these diverse satellite-based models expand the toolkit for remote discovery of Amazonian sites when LiDAR data are unavailable.

## Predictive Modeling of Site Locations
Another successful machine learning strategy doesn’t “see” structures directly, but rather predicts where sites are likely to be, by learning from known site locations and environmental factors. In 2023, Walker et al. developed a multi-class ML model to predict the distribution of ancient Amazonian earthworks and Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) sites across the entire rainforest
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. They tested various algorithms (neural networks, SVMs, gradient boosting, etc.) and found that a random forest classifier performed best, consistently outperforming other methods in accuracy
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The chosen model was trained on a dataset of known archaeological locations (geometric earthworks, ADE soil sites, etc.) along with 65 geospatial predictor variables – including climate data, terrain, soil properties (like phosphorus levels), and distances to rivers
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. By learning correlations between environmental patterns and where past peoples built sites, the random forest could score any given 1-km grid cell for site probability. The model proved highly effective: using rigorous spatial cross-validation, it achieved an AUC ~0.91 with ~88% accuracy in distinguishing site-present vs. absent areas
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Notably, distance to waterways and seasonal climate emerged as top predictors (e.g. earthworks cluster in areas with a pronounced dry season)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This indicates the model picked up genuine ecological preferences of ancient settlements.

The results of such predictive models directly guide fieldwork. Walker’s random forest generated maps of “hotspot” regions where undiscovered earthworks or ADEs are statistically likely
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Crucially, they filtered out already-deforested areas (where sites would likely have been spotted) to focus on still-forested zones
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The outcome is a practical treasure map for archaeologists – highlighting patches of forest that should be LiDAR-scanned or surveyed on foot. Likewise, an international team led by Vinícius Peripato in 2023 combined LiDAR findings with statistical modeling to estimate the total unseen sites in Amazonia. After flying LiDAR surveys over just 0.08% of the Brazilian Amazon, they discovered 24 new archaeological structures (earthworks) in multiple states
news.exeter.ac.uk
. Feeding this data plus 937 known sites into a Bayesian regression model, they predicted that over 10,000 (perhaps even ~16,000) earthwork sites remain hidden under Amazon forest cover
uu.nl
. Their model incorporated variables like rainfall, temperature, soil type, and proximity to water, much like Walker’s, to extrapolate site probabilities across the vast unsurveyed areas
uu.nl
. One striking outcome of this work was the recognition of ecological indicators: the study found that dozens of tree species (such as Brazil nut, wild cacao, and others) are strongly associated with ancient habitation sites
news.exeter.ac.uk
uu.nl
. These are domesticated or useful species likely propagated by past peoples, now persisting in higher densities at old village locations. By including such botanical data, the model effectively uses the Amazon’s living ecosystem as a proxy sensor for archaeology. As Dr. Hans ter Steege explained, there is significant “overlap between the places where the earthworks are found and where domesticated species are present… in some areas, these trees are so abundant that they must have been planted by people.”
uu.nl
. This insight, powered by ML analysis, is enhancing survey accuracy – for example, archaeologists can prioritize investigation in forest patches rich in certain legacy fruit trees or palms.

## New Discoveries and Impact
The integration of machine learning with remote sensing has already led to concrete discoveries and a reevaluation of Amazonian history. Thanks to LiDAR and ML-aided approaches, archaeologists have uncovered complex pre-Columbian landscapes beneath what was once thought to be pristine jungle. In Brazil’s southern Amazon, the identification of those “clock face” mound villages connected by road networks

demonstrated large, organized communities where none were previously recorded. In central Amazon (Santarém region), ML-guided LiDAR mapping extended known settlement boundaries, expanding the timeline and reach of human influence
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The random forest site prediction model by Walker et al. highlighted specific unstudied areas in Amazonia that are now yielding new finds as archaeologists follow up on its high-probability predictions
news.exeter.ac.uk
news.exeter.ac.uk
. Meanwhile, the 2023 Science study by Peripato et al. not only found new earthworks via LiDAR but also quantitatively demonstrated that human engineering of the landscape was far more extensive than assumed – likely about 10% of the entire Amazon contains earthwork modifications
news.exeter.ac.uk
news.exeter.ac.uk
. This has huge implications for conservation and our understanding of indigenous land use.

In terms of effectiveness, these models have greatly enhanced survey accuracy and efficiency. Instead of blind exploration in arduous jungle, researchers can now target “red zones” flagged by algorithms – whether that be a LiDAR-derived anomaly map or a probability heatmap – making field surveys and drone LiDAR flights far more likely to succeed. The models have proven their worth by successfully pinpointing buried features: for example, TechnoLynx’s AI system (an industry application) identified multiple ancient settlement sites in the Brazilian Amazon that were later confirmed on the ground

. Even when ML models are used in a supporting role (e.g. preprocessing data or narrowing search areas), they contribute to new findings. The fusion of AI with remote sensing has essentially “X-rayed” the rainforest, unveiling roads, canals, mounds, and even an entire lost 18th-century fortress town once swallowed by the jungle

. As a result, the narrative of the Amazon as an untouched wilderness has flipped – a change driven in large part by the computational ability to detect what human eyes could not.

In summary, recent years have seen multiple successful ML-based approaches for discovering Amazon’s hidden archaeology: deep learning models analyzing LiDAR to spot ancient infrastructure beneath the canopy, spectral classification models finding anthropogenic soil areas via canopy cues, and predictive spatial models that integrate environmental and ecological data to pinpoint likely site locations. These methods have shown high effectiveness (often 80–90%+ accuracy in tests) and have directly led to new archaeological discoveries and more efficient surveys

. As remote sensing data only increase (with more LiDAR coverage, new satellites, and possibly radar mapping), we can expect machine learning to play an even greater role in illuminating the Amazon’s rich human past – all while minimizing disturbance to the forest itself.
