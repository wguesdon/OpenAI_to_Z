Based on current literature and recent archaeological discoveries, here are the most likely sites in the Amazon rainforest to contain undiscovered archaeological sites, with GPS coordinates for areas of interest:
Major Archaeological Hotspots with Known Sites
1. Upano Valley, Ecuador

General area: 2°S, 78°W
Sangay site: Near the Sangay volcano foothills
Kilamope site: Features a platform measuring 140m × 40m
Kunguints site: Along the Upano riverbed cliff edge

2. Llanos de Mojos, Bolivia
The Llanos de Mojos in Bolivia's Beni Department spans approximately 110,000-200,000 km² and contains the Casarabe culture sites ClassicultWikipedia:

General area: 14-16°S, 64-66°W
Cotoca site: One of the largest urban centers (315 ha)
Landívar site: Major settlement (147 ha)
Casarabe culture area: Approximately 4,500 km²

3. Acre State, Brazil
Acre state in western Brazil contains over 450 geoglyph sites distributed over 13,000 km² WikipediaHowStuffWorks:

General coordinates: 9°S, 70°W
Elevation range: 180-280m on interfluvial plateaus
Key rivers: Acre, Iquiri, and Abunã rivers

Predicted High-Potential Areas for Undiscovered Sites
Based on Predictive Models:

Southwest Amazon Basin
Predictive models indicate between 10,272 and 23,648 large-scale pre-Columbian structures remain undiscovered, particularly in southwestern Amazonia Geolocation of unpublished archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon | Scientific Data
Eastern Amazon River Corridors
Terra preta sites are most likely to be found in central and eastern Amazonia on bluffs overlooking rivers nearing the Atlantic Ocean Geolocation of unpublished archaeological sites in the Peruvian Amazon - PMC
Specific Environmental Indicators:

Elevation: 180-280m above sea level
Proximity to water: Within 5-10km of rivers or lakes
Topography: Gentle slopes, river terraces, or bluffs
Soil types: Areas with potential terra preta (anthropogenic dark earth)



4. Peru - Department of Loreto
Over 400 known but unpublished sites exist in Loreto, with coordinates ranging across this 368,851 km² region A deep-learning model for predictive archaeology and archaeological community detection | Humanities and Social Sciences Communications
Key Search Patterns for New Sites:

Look for circular or geometric patterns visible in deforested areas
Focus on interfluvial plateaus between major rivers
Search areas with domesticated tree species (Brazil nut, cacao, rubber trees)
Target locations 1-3km from water sources
Prioritize areas with suitable elevation (200-300m for most sites)

Technology Recommendations:

Use LiDAR scanning for areas with dense forest cover
Employ satellite imagery analysis for recently deforested regions
Apply machine learning models to identify geometric patterns
Combine environmental data (soil, climate, hydrology) with predictive modeling

Current estimates suggest more than 90% of ancient earthworks remain concealed under the Amazon canopy Laser mapping reveals hidden structures in Amazon—with hints at thousands more | Science | AAAS, making this one of the most promising regions for archaeological discovery in the world.
These coordinates and search patterns represent the best current understanding of where undiscovered archaeological sites are most likely to be found in the Amazon, based on environmental patterns, known site distributions, and predictive modeling from recent research.

## Notes for Mapping

**These coordinates define rectangular search areas. For more precise mapping, consider that archaeological sites typically cluster along:**

- River bluffs and terraces
- Interfluvial plateaus (180-300m elevation)
- Areas with terra preta (anthropogenic dark earth)
- Locations 1-10km from water sources

**Data Sources:**
- LiDAR surveys from recent archaeological expeditions
- Predictive modeling based on environmental factors
- Published archaeological research (2020-2025)
- Machine learning predictions for undiscovered sites

These boundaries encompass the highest probability areas for undiscovered archaeological sites based on current research and predictive modeling.
