# Likely Locations of Archaeological Sites in the Brazilian Amazon
Original Question: Identify the locations in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest that are most likely to be linked to archaeological sites. Consider all historical periods. Analyze and synthesize correlations with key features such as proximity to water bodies, soil fertility (e.g., Terra Preta), proximity to known pre-Columbian or historic settlements, evidence of past agricultural or habitation activity (e.g., geoglyphs, mounds), accessibility and interaction zones (e.g., river confluences, trade routes), and previous archaeological discoveries and research clusters.

## Overview
The Brazilian Amazon is rich in archaeological sites, many still hidden under its vast rainforest canopy. Researchers are uncovering evidence that ancient Indigenous societies inhabited large swathes of Amazonia for millennia, leaving behind earthworks, enriched soils, and other traces of complex communities. To predict where undiscovered sites are likely, archaeologists correlate known site locations with key environmental and cultural factors. Notably, sites tend to cluster in areas with access to waterways, fertile anthropogenic soils (Terra Preta), and other signs of past habitation or land use. Early historical accounts by Europeans also hinted at dense populations along major rivers, and modern research using LiDAR and predictive modeling confirms that pre-Columbian occupation was widespread rather than random

. Below, we analyze how each factor contributes to identifying likely archaeological hotspots in the Brazilian Amazon.

phys.org
. This map (based on recent LiDAR studies) highlights six regions – Central Amazonia (CA), Eastern Amazonia (EA), Guiana Shield (GS), Northwestern Amazonia (NwA), Southern Amazonia (SA), and Southwestern Amazonia (SwA) – where earthworks have been found
phys.org
. Notice the dense clustering of sites in the southern and southwestern Amazon (purple-highlighted areas), while fewer known sites appear in the far northwest. Indeed, predictive models indicate that human-made earthworks occur in roughly 10% of the Amazon’s area (especially along its southern rim), whereas the remaining 90% of the forest has a very low probability of containing such features
phys.org
.

## Waterways and River Confluences
Rivers and Lakes as Settlement Magnets: Throughout all periods, people in Amazonia gravitated toward water. Most known archaeological sites are found near rivers, streams, or lakes, often on bluffs or terraces just above floodplains
eos.org
. These elevated riverbanks provided access to transportation, fish, and fertile floodplain soils, while staying safe from annual floods. For example, many pre-Columbian villages and towns were situated along the Amazon River and its tributaries, forming chains of settlements linked by the waterways
scientificamerican.com
. Historic chronicles from the 16th century described continuous villages along the main Amazon River, with large canoes and marketplaces – an early hint of how densely populated these river corridors were
scientificamerican.com
. Archaeological research has since confirmed major cultural centers at strategic river confluences: Marajó Island at the Amazon’s mouth, the Santarém area where the Tapajós joins the Amazon, and the Manaus region at the Rio Negro confluence all show evidence of extensive pre-Columbian occupation
scientificamerican.com
. In these locations, proximity to multiple rivers would have created interaction hubs for trade and travel, making them likely hotspots for past settlement.

River Confluences and Trade Routes: Confluences – where two or more rivers meet – offered ideal conditions for larger settlements. They facilitated exchange between different regions and ecological zones, serving as “interaction zones” for trade networks. Santarém, for instance, was the center of the ancient Tapajó polity around AD 1000–1600 and spanned ~4 km² near the Tapajós-Amazon junction
research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk
. Such sites suggest that people intentionally occupied nodes of river systems to control trade and communication. Similarly, in the Upper Xingu (southern Amazon), indigenous roads and canoe paths connected villages, indicating a landscape organized around waterways and overland routes between them
scientificamerican.com
. Even in the colonial era, European forts and missions were established at key river junctures (e.g., Fort São José where Manaus stands) – often on or near earlier indigenous settlements – underscoring the enduring strategic value of these locations. Thus, areas along major rivers, especially at confluences or river islands, are prime candidates for archaeological sites across all periods.

## Terra Preta and Fertile Soils (Anthropogenic Dark Earths)
Anthropogenic Soils as Settlement Footprints: Terra Preta (“Amazonian Dark Earth”) is a human-made, nutrient-rich soil found in many parts of the Amazon, and it is one of the clearest indicators of past habitation. These dark, charcoal-flecked soils were created by pre-Columbian peoples through the slow accumulation of charcoal, food waste, manure, and other organic material over generations
news.mongabay.com
eos.org
. They stand out against the typically acidic, nutrient-poor natural soils of the rainforest, and their presence almost always signals an ancient settlement. In fact, archaeologists note that wherever Amazonian dark earth is found, there is always abundant archaeological material – such as pottery shards, food remains, and even human burials – embedded in it
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. These soils essentially mark the sites of former villages, gardens, and middens, making them invaluable clues to ancient habitation.

Widespread Distribution of Terra Preta: Extensive surveys have identified hundreds of dark earth sites across the Brazilian Amazon
eos.org
. Estimates suggest that known Terra Preta patches cover between 6,000 and 18,000 square kilometers of Amazonia, and modeling studies predict the true extent could be much larger – perhaps over 150,000 km² (about 3% of the forest)
eos.org
. This wide distribution implies that ancient communities were not random in the landscape; instead, they repeatedly enriched soils in preferred locations. These locations tend to be on bluffs or slight elevations near water, as people chose well-drained, non-flooding spots to settle and farm
eos.org
. Over time, their agricultural practices and waste created pockets of unusually fertile soil. The fertility of Terra Preta likely made these spots attractive for long-term habitation – and even in later periods, indigenous and local communities often reuse dark earth areas for cultivation due to their high productivity
eos.org
. Thus, mapping Terra Preta is a powerful tool for predicting archaeological sites: if a locale has sizable dark earth deposits, it was almost certainly a significant habitation or farming site in the pre-Columbian era
nature.com
. Modern studies have confirmed the human origin of these soils, showing that their formation peaked in the late Holocene (~1,000 years ago) when Amazon populations were growing and intensifying land use
nature.com
. In summary, clusters of Terra Preta (especially near waterways) are likely hotspots of ancient activity, combining fertile land with evidence of sustained human occupation.

## Pre-Columbian Settlements and Known Site Clusters
Major Archaeological Regions: Research over the past few decades has revealed several regions in the Brazilian Amazon with high densities of archaeological sites, each corresponding to flourishing pre-Columbian cultures. These known clusters guide our understanding of what locales are most likely to harbor undiscovered sites. Key regions include:
- Lower Amazon (Eastern Amazonia): The area around the Amazon River’s mouth and lower course was home to complex societies. Marajó Island in Pará is famous for the Marajoara culture (c. 400–1300 AD), which built large earthen mounds to elevate villages above the floods
amazon.com
amazon.com
. Archaeologists have found ceremonial centers, burial mounds, and elaborate polychrome pottery on Marajó, indicating a dense population supported by fisheries and agriculture on the island’s fertile floodplains
amazon.com
. Similarly, the Santarém region (Tapajós River confluence) was an indigenous urban center noted for its fine ceramics and extensive dark earth. Early European observers marveled at the “great settlements” in this area, and modern digs have uncovered large habitation sites and evidence of regional trade
scientificamerican.com
. These lower Amazon sites are typically near major rivers, on levees or high ground adjacent to rich aquatic resources – locations that likely hold even more undiscovered middens, habitation layers, and earthworks in their vicinity.
- Central Amazon (Mid Amazon Basin): In the central Amazon (broadly, the states of Amazonas and adjacent areas), many archaeological sites align with varzea (floodplain) environments and old river courses. For example, around the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon near present-day Manaus, researchers have documented extensive Terra Preta deposits and artifacts, suggesting large villages existed there
scientificamerican.com
. Farther upriver, along the middle Amazon/Solimões and its tributaries (Purus, Madeira, etc.), numerous smaller sites have been recorded on river bluffs. A recent discovery in Amazonas state (near Parintins) found ancient household remains and dark earth in local backyards, revealing continuous occupation in a “floating terrace” landscape of lakes and channels
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. Riverside plateaus and lake shores in the central basin – especially where old channels or natural levees provide habitable terrain – are prime locations for finding archaeological remains (such as shell middens, fishing camps, and village sites) that correspond to both pre-Columbian and historic indigenous use. Some central Amazon sites also feature fish weirs and canal structures, indicating specialized adaptations to the seasonal flood cycle
english.elpais.com
.
- Southern Amazon (Southern Rim): A vast stretch of the southern Amazon, along the transition between rainforest and cerrado (savanna), was heavily occupied by earth-building cultures in late pre-Columbian times. Archaeologists have now traced an 1800-km continuous belt of fortified villages and ceremonial earthworks from the Bolivian Amazon across the Brazilian states of Acre, Rondônia, and Mato Grosso
nature.com
. In the Upper Xingu River basin (northern Mato Grosso), for instance, large settled clusters dating ~AD 1000–1500 have been documented: networks of circular villages with roads radiating out, surrounded by ditched enclosures and defensive palisades
scientificamerican.com
. These Xingu settlements were interconnected by straight roads and even causeways over wetlands, forming a regional urban system (“garden cities”) rather than isolated villages
scientificamerican.com
. Farther west in Acre and southern Amazonas, hundreds of geometric earthworks (see next section) and ditched village sites have been found, proving that populations were also thriving away from the major rivers
nature.com
. The entire southern rim, often in interfluvial areas between smaller streams, sustained surprisingly high population densities in pre-Columbian times
nature.com
. Therefore, areas along the southern fringe of the Amazon – especially in Acre, Rondônia, and northern Mato Grosso – are very likely to contain archaeological sites, even in places previously assumed to be “untouched” rainforest. These sites tend to be on slightly elevated, well-drained soils between seasonal streams, where earthworks and terra preta now reveal ancient habitation
nature.com
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
- Southwestern Amazon (Acre region): The state of Acre (SW Amazon) deserves special mention due to the remarkable concentration of geoglyphs – large geometric earthworks (circles, squares, octagons, etc.) formed by ditches and mounds. Over 450 of these prehistoric geometric enclosures have been mapped in eastern Acre, spread across ~13,000 km² of deforested land
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. They remained hidden under rainforest until modern deforestation exposed them in satellite images in the 21st century. While Acre’s geoglyphs were likely ceremonial or gathering sites rather than residential villages (since they lack artifacts in their interiors), their abundance implies a dense network of communities in the area between roughly 500 BC and AD 950
world-archaeology.com
world-archaeology.com
. The geoglyph builders also left traces of habitation nearby – including Terra Preta, pottery, and small mounds – indicating that people lived around these ceremonial enclosures. Acre’s neighboring areas (western Amazonas state and northern Bolivia) have similar earthworks. Given that geoglyphs keep appearing wherever new forest is cleared
world-archaeology.com
, it’s likely that many more exist under intact forest. Thus, regions of southwestern Amazonia with open bamboo forests or transitional forest (where geoglyphs are concentrated) are prime targets for finding additional archaeological sites, both ceremonial and domestic
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
- Northern Amazon (Guiana Shield): In the far north of Brazil (Roraima and northern Amazonas states), the terrain rises toward the Guiana Shield highlands. Recent research is revealing that even these areas, long thought marginal, saw ancient human activity. For example, scientists have identified sites on flat-topped plateaus (tepuis) and mountain slopes that were modified by Indigenous groups
english.elpais.com
. Some sites in the Guiana Shield region include rock art and rock shelters, while others are hilltop earthworks possibly used for ritual or defensive purposes
english.elpais.com
. The soil in certain highland locations has been found to contain dark earth patches, suggesting small farming communities. Although fewer sites are known in the dense upland forests, the discovery of ceremonial use of mountains
english.elpais.com
 hints that more remain to be found. Additionally, along the northern rivers like the Rio Branco and upper Negro (northwestern Amazon), ethnographic and linguistic evidence points to past trade routes crossing the Guianas. Likely site locations in the north include river headwaters, falls or rapids (which often have fishtraps and petroglyphs), and ecotone areas where savanna meets forest (used seasonally by diverse groups). As surveying improves, the Guiana Shield and NW Amazon are expected to yield more archaeological sites, though currently they appear less dense than the southern and central regions

## Landscape Modifications: Earthworks, Mounds, and Agricultural Features
Geoglyphs and Earthworks: Large-scale earthworks are a signature feature of Amazonian archaeology, and their presence is a strong indicator of ancient habitation zones. These include the Acre geoglyphs discussed above – massive geometric ditches up to 11 m wide and 4 m deep
world-archaeology.com
 – as well as fortified village earthworks (circular or rectangular ditches around settlements) found in parts of Amazonas, Rondônia, and Mato Grosso. When such structures are spotted (often via aerial LiDAR or satellite imagery), they almost certainly date to pre-Columbian times and point to associated archaeological remains in the vicinity. For instance, in the Upper Xingu, researchers mapped deep ditches over 2 km long enclosing ancient town sites, connected by causeways and roads
scientificamerican.com
. Similarly, the southern Amazon Nature Communications study (2018) predicted that earthwork sites (ditched enclosures, mounds, and others) could be found over roughly 400,000 km² of southern Amazonia, far beyond the floodplains
nature.com
. These earthworks often occur in clusters, suggesting regional populations that coordinated in construction. Locations with visible geometric patterns in the terrain – whether through deforestation “crop circles” or LiDAR-detected relief – are highly likely to be archaeological. Indeed, dozens of new earthworks have been discovered by simply examining cleared patches of forest on Google Earth
english.elpais.com
world-archaeology.com
. This means that current agricultural frontiers (where forest is being cleared) frequently reveal earthworks, highlighting ancient occupation of those lands.

Mounds and Raised Fields: In various parts of the Amazon, past societies built earthen mounds and artificial raised fields for habitation and agriculture. Along the floodplains of the Amazon and its tributaries, habitation mounds (sometimes called tesos) were constructed to escape flooding. Marajó Island’s mounds are the largest example – some reaching 20 meters high and supporting entire villages and ceremonial centers
amazon.com
amazon.com
. Elsewhere, smaller habitation mounds and shell middens dot the várzeas, marking ancient villages and camps. In seasonally flooded savannas (like the Llanos de Moxos just beyond Brazil in Bolivia, and possibly parts of Amazonas state), prehistoric farmers created raised field grids and fish ponds to expand arable land and manage aquatic resources
smithsonianmag.com
anthropology.sas.upenn.edu
. Any sign of gridded ditches, linear mounds, or unusual elevation in flat wetland areas could indicate such landscape engineering. For example, pre-Columbian people in the border regions built networks of fish weirs and canals to trap fish during flood recession
smithsonianmag.com
. The 2023 Science study noted “riverside sites in the central Amazon plains that were used to collect fish during the rise and fall of water levels”
english.elpais.com
, pointing to features like curved dikes or pond-like depressions near river channels. Therefore, locales with evidence of altered drainage – whether remnants of canals in floodplains or ringed levees around pond areas – are likely linked to ancient subsistence activities.

Vegetation and Biodiversity Signals: Interestingly, the legacy of ancient land use is sometimes visible in the forest cover itself. Archaeologists and ecologists have found that certain useful plants (fruit trees like Brazil nut, acai palm, peach palm, etc.) occur at unusually high densities around former settlements
eos.org
eos.org
. In the absence of obvious ruins, these “orchard forests” or clusters of domesticable species can act as a proxy for human influence. The 2023 Amazon-wide study identified 53 tree species that are significantly associated with earthwork sites – essentially living indicators of past human management
researchgate.net
. Areas with concentrations of useful fruit trees or Brazil nut groves in the wild might signal past villages or camps, where people planted or encouraged those species. Additionally, patches of bamboo forest in southwest Amazon have been linked to geoglyph areas (since people maintained clearings that promoted bamboo regrowth)
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Modern indigenous people, like the Kuikuro in Xingu, still use ancient dark earth sites to plant their gardens due to the richer soil
eos.org
. All these clues reinforce that the Amazon’s current ecology often harbors signs of its former inhabitants. By combining ecological data with remote sensing, researchers are increasingly able to pinpoint likely archaeological site locations even before ground survey

## Accessibility and Interaction Zones
Navigational Corridors: We have touched on rivers as arteries of settlement; here we emphasize that accessibility for movement and communication was a key factor in where people settled. In the dense rainforest, rivers served as highways. Any location that provided a junction or crossroads – be it a river confluence, a portage between waterways, or a gap in rapids – would have been strategically important. For example, the ancient roads in the Xingu suggest that people also cleared overland paths linking communities and resources
scientificamerican.com
. Traders and travelers likely had well-known routes from the Amazon Basin up into the Andes, or from the Negro basin over into the Orinoco, etc. Evidence of long-distance trade (like marine shell or jade artifacts found deep in Amazonia) implies certain hubs where such goods passed through. We can thus predict that river portage points and watershed divides that were traversable might host archaeological sites such as encampments or rock art marking travel routes.

Cultural Interaction Frontiers: Interaction zones are also found at ecological boundaries – for instance, where forest meets savanna or where highland meets lowland. Such edges often became trade or exchange frontiers between different groups. In the southern Amazon, the border of the rainforest (the “arc of forest”) likely saw exchange between agriculturalists and neighboring peoples of the open cerrado. Indeed, the distribution of similar pottery styles and crops across wide areas hints at robust interaction networks. Places that allowed access to multiple resources (fish from rivers, game from forest, open land for farming) would be prime settlement choices. One vivid account from 1720 described the headwaters of the Tapajós (a transitional area) as “densely settled, with many villages in a day’s march, wide straight roads, and large houses”
scientificamerican.com
 – showing that even deep inland, accessibility within a mosaic landscape fostered complex societies. Thus, regions that served as crossroads – whether riverine or terrestrial – are strong candidates for archaeological sites, as communities there could leverage diverse connections.

## Previous Discoveries and Research Clusters
Known Sites as Anchors: Archaeological research in Amazonia has often focused on areas where initial finds were promising. These “research clusters” in turn highlight likely patterns applicable to other areas. For example, the discovery of the Acre geoglyphs opened archaeologists’ eyes to the possibility of extensive settlements in interfluvial forests
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Subsequent predictive modeling now suggests that the southwestern Amazon (Acre and adjacent areas) holds the highest probability for undiscovered earthworks
researchgate.net
. Similarly, the famous Xingu cluster studied by Heckenberger and colleagues – with its network of prehistoric towns – provides a template to search for analogous networks along other Amazon tributaries in southern Pará and northern Mato Grosso. The Marajó and Santarém excavations (by Meggers, Roosevelt, and others) not only catalogued those specific cultures but also demonstrated the scale of Amazonian chiefdoms on the lower Amazon, guiding surveys along nearby riverbanks for additional mound sites and dark earth. In essence, every major discovery has broadened the map of where we expect human influence. Areas around known sites remain rich exploration targets (for instance, smaller satellite settlements around great villages like those in Santarém or Xingu). Additionally, regions lying between known clusters could harbor as-yet-unrecognized sites that formed the “connecting dots” in the broader civilization landscape. For instance, between the well-studied Llanos de Mojos (in Bolivia) and the Brazilian Upper Xingu, one might expect continuous settlement – a hypothesis now supported by finds in the southern Amazon rim across Rondônia and Mato Grosso
nature.com
. Ongoing LiDAR surveys and local community reports are helping pinpoint such sites.

Technology and Ongoing Discoveries: Finally, it’s important to note that what we consider “likely locations” is evolving rapidly with new technology. LiDAR scanning has recently penetrated even the densest Amazon forests, revealing built features like causeways, reservoirs, and terracing that were invisible before. For example, a five-year aerial LiDAR campaign over just 0.08% of the Brazilian Amazon detected 24 previously unknown sites – including ceremonial centers on hilltops and fishery structures by rivers
english.elpais.com
english.elpais.com
. This suggests that many more remain concealed. The model from that study predicts tens of thousands of undiscovered large sites, especially in regions that match the profiles discussed: near water, on fertile soils, in slightly elevated terrain, often along the southern and western parts of the basin
researchgate.net
. In short, the most fruitful areas to search today are those that check multiple boxes: for instance, a junction of rivers with adjacent dark earth patches and a history of past finds in the general area. Thanks to interdisciplinary approaches – combining archaeology, ecology, remote sensing, and indigenous knowledge – our ability to identify these locations has greatly improved. What is now clear is that the Amazon is not a “pristine wilderness” but a cultural landscape, and seemingly remote spots can hold the remains of ancient engineered environments
english.elpais.com
news.mongabay.com
. By focusing on the correlations outlined above, researchers and local communities are continuing to unveil the Amazon’s long human history and pinpoint where its next archaeological discoveries are most likely to emerge.
