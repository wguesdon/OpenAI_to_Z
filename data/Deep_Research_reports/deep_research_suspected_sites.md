Hidden Archaeological Hotspots of the Amazon Rainforest
Introduction
The Amazon rainforest, long mythologized as an untouched wilderness, is now recognized as a landscape rich with ancient human history. Recent academic studies (within the last 5–10 years) suggest that thousands of undiscovered archaeological sites lie beneath the Amazon’s canopy

. These potential sites include ancient urban centers, geometric earthworks (geoglyphs), extensive settlements, ceremonial structures, and other engineered landscapes. New evidence has upended the old assumption that Amazonia could only support small, nomadic tribes – instead revealing that millions of people once inhabited complex societies across the region

. Researchers are now focusing on specific subregions – particular river basins, interfluvial zones, and cultural frontiers – believed to be hotspots of hidden archaeological remains. Remote Sensing and New Discoveries: A driving force behind these revelations is the use of advanced remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). LiDAR’s laser-mapping ability allows scientists to “see” through dense forest canopy and map ground features in high resolution. In recent years, LiDAR surveys have exposed entire networks of pre-Columbian cities and infrastructure that were previously invisible. For example, a 2022 project led by the German Archaeological Institute used helicopter-mounted LiDAR to digitally deforest parts of the Bolivian Amazon, revealing a vast urban settlement of the Casarabe culture with pyramid mounds, causeways, reservoirs, and canals

. Similarly, in 2023–2024, a Franco-Ecuadorian team employed LiDAR in Ecuador’s Amazonian foothills to uncover a 2,500-year-old cityscape of earthen platforms and an orthogonal road grid – the oldest large-scale urban system identified in Amazonia to date

. These discoveries underscore how transformative LiDAR has been for Amazon archaeology, often accomplishing in days what would take decades on foot

. Aside from LiDAR, researchers are also leveraging satellite imagery, machine learning models, and even the distribution of certain tree species to predict where undiscovered sites are likely to be

. Such imaging revealed multiple lost cities of the Casarabe culture in 2022, proving that parts of Amazonia had low-density urbanism hundreds of years ago.

Southwestern Amazon (Acre, Brazil & Adjacent Areas) – Geoglyphs and Earthworks
One of the most prominent archaeological hotspots lies in the southwestern Amazon, spanning the borderlands of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. In Brazil’s Acre state, hundreds of geometric geoglyphs (large earthwork enclosures in shapes like circles, squares, and octagons) were first noticed in deforested areas and are now believed to number over 450
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These earthworks – often consisting of deep ditches forming geometric patterns – remained hidden under jungle canopy for centuries. Excavations show they likely served ceremonial or communal functions (few habitation remains are found within them), and some may have been ritual gathering places or defensive structures
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Archaeologists have dated many Acre geoglyphs to roughly 0–1250 CE, but a 2020 study revealed evidence of human-modified soils in Acre as early as 10,000 years ago, suggesting a very long history of land use
cambridge.org
scielo.br
. Recent remote-sensing work indicates the earthworks of southwestern Amazonia are far more extensive than currently mapped. A 2023 Science study (with a team of over 200 researchers) scanned ~5,300 km² of LiDAR data across Amazonia and discovered 24 previously unrecorded sites – 10 of these were geoglyph-type earthworks in Acre’s forests
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. These newly found enclosures, located near the towns of Senador Guiomard and Rio Branco, match the form of known Acre geoglyphs and even contained funerary urns in some cases, indicating ceremonial use
news.mongabay.com
. Yet, they showed little evidence of daily habitation (no pottery or anthropogenic dark soil inside), reinforcing that these were likely ceremonial or community gathering sites rather than villages
news.mongabay.com
. Because LiDAR only surveyed a tiny fraction of Acre’s remaining forest, archaeologists extrapolate that thousands more such earthworks await discovery under intact canopy. Indeed, statistical modeling of site distributions suggests the closed-canopy forests across southwestern Amazonia may conceal an additional 10,000 or more pre-Columbian earthworks of various types
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. This region is considered a major cradle of Amazonian complexity – it boasts early evidence of crop domestication (manioc, peanuts, coca, etc.) and may be a hearth of the Arawak and Tupi language families
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Ongoing projects by Brazilian researchers (e.g. at the Federal University of Acre and São Paulo’s MAE/USP) and international teams (University of Exeter, etc.) are actively surveying Acre’s interfluvial zones using satellite pattern analysis and targeted LiDAR, often in collaboration with local Indigenous communities. These efforts have already led to new discoveries, such as previously unknown ditch enclosures detected via machine-learning prediction in the Purus–Madeira interfluve (e.g. in the Chandless River basin and Bolivia’s Manuripi reserve) where small deforested patches revealed faint geometric shapes
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Southwestern Amazonia’s geoglyph and earthwork “tattoos” on the landscape mark it as one of the most promising regions for finding lost ceremonial centers and settlement traces.
Upper Xingu Basin (Mato Grosso, Brazil) – Fortified Villages and “Garden Cities”
Another focal region for undiscovered sites is the Upper Xingu River basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This southern Amazon area is known for its pre-Columbian settlement clusters that have been described as “garden cities” – large villages organized in a decentralized network connected by roads and surrounded by extensive agriculture and managed forests
smithsonianmag.com
. Michael Heckenberger and colleagues (University of Florida, in partnership with the Kuikuro Indigenous people) began documenting ancient Kuikuro settlements here in the early 2000s. They found that from ~800–1600 CE, the Upper Xingu had populous towns built around central plazas, linked by straight roads and featuring defensive earthworks like encircling ditches and palisades
smithsonianmag.com
. These settlements lacked stone pyramids or huge mounds, but their scale and planning indicated a complex, sedentary society. Recent studies suggest that even more fortified village sites remain undiscovered in the Upper Xingu and surrounding southern Amazon uplands. LiDAR data has begun to confirm this. The 2023 Amazon lidar survey detected six new archaeological sites in Mato Grosso’s Upper Xingu Basin that appear to be part of an ancient fortified village cluster
news.mongabay.com
. These sites revealed a constellation of features characteristic of a coordinated urban layout: peripheral ditches, road networks, raised causeways between sites, artificial reservoirs and fish ponds, and even remnants of earthen dams and weirs for water management
news.mongabay.com
. Such findings align with earlier ground surveys, but the lidar uncovered greater connectivity – suggesting the villages were organized as a regional system (a peer-network of settlements) rather than isolated communities. Archaeologists interpret this as evidence of an “intermediate” social form: not a single centralized city, but a galactic polity of many villages that shared infrastructure and urban planning principles
news.mongabay.com
smithsonianmag.com
. Because the Upper Xingu has dense forest cover in many areas, LiDAR is helping pinpoint these subtle landscape modifications (like slight depressions or embankments) that mark village boundaries and ancient roadbeds. Brazilian institutions such as the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) are actively involved – the lead author of the 2023 study, Vinícius Peripato, is a geographer at INPE who uses remote sensing to map such sites
news.mongabay.com
. Given that less than 0.1% of the Amazon has been lidar-scanned so far
news.mongabay.com
, the Upper Xingu and adjacent basins (e.g. upper Tapajós and Juruena rivers) are prime targets for expanded surveys. Archaeologists consider this a hotspot where “lost” moated towns and road networks will continue to be revealed, deepening our understanding of pre-Columbian urbanism in the Amazon.
Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) – Urban Landscapes in Seasonally Flooded Savanna
Spanning the Bolivian Amazon’s Llanos de Moxos (Mojos) plains, the southwestern Amazon savanna-forest mosaic has emerged as a dramatic example of undiscovered archaeological wealth. This region – a lowland crossed by rivers and seasonal wetlands – was home to the Casarabe culture (c. 500–1400 CE), an agrarian society that built some of the largest known pre-Hispanic structures in Amazonia
smithsonianmag.com
thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org
. Until recently, knowledge of Casarabe settlements came from a few excavated mounds and causeways, but their true scope was unclear. In 2022, a groundbreaking LiDAR survey (Nature, May 2022) led by Heiko Prümers (German Archaeological Institute) unveiled an entire hidden cityscape beneath the Moxos region forest
thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org
thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org
. The lidar mapped two large urban centers (each over 100 hectares, such as the site of Cotoca) with monumental platform mounds, conical pyramids up to 22 m high, and vast plazas
thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org
. Connecting these cores was a network of straight, raised roads extending for miles, linking dozens of smaller villages in a low-density urban web
smithsonianmag.com
. The images also showed an elaborate water management system: interconnected canals, reservoirs, and causeway dams controlling seasonal floods
smithsonianmag.com
. This discovery provides the “clearest case of a fully urbanized Amazonian landscape,” according to experts
smithsonianmag.com
 – in essence, an Amazonian civilization that engineered its environment on a large scale. Crucially, only limited portions of Llanos de Moxos have been surveyed, implying that many more settlements remain undetected in the surrounding forests and savannas. Earlier archaeological work had identified hundreds of smaller sites across ~4,500 km² of Moxos
smithsonianmag.com
, including villages with ring ditches, causeways, and artificial fish ponds. The 2022 LiDAR, however, demonstrated these were part of a much larger integrated system, encouraging researchers to expand surveys. The newly revealed sites in Bolivia highlight that even areas of Amazonia once deemed too remote or flood-prone can harbor “lost cities”. It is expected that further remote sensing in the Bolivian Amazon (and adjacent parts of Brazil’s Acre and Rondônia states, which share a similar environment) will turn up additional large earthwork complexes. International collaborations – e.g. Bolivia’s archaeology unit, the DAI, and universities like Bonn and Exeter – are continuing to explore this savanna-forest frontier, combining LiDAR with ground verification. The Llanos de Moxos stands out as a hotspot where undiscovered ceremonial centers, settlements with zigzagging fish weirs, and massive linear earthworks are highly likely

Andean-Amazon Foothills (Ecuador and Peru) – Hidden Highlander Cities
At the western edge of the Amazon basin, where the rainforest meets the foothills of the Andes, archaeologists have begun to find evidence of ancient urban or ceremonial centers – suggesting the Andean-Amazon frontier is another promising region. In Ecuador’s eastern lowlands, for instance, decades of hints and local legends have recently been confirmed by science. In 2024, researchers using LiDAR in the Upano Valley (Morona-Santiago province, Ecuador) uncovered a vast complex of settlements dating to 500 BCE – 600 CE
smithsonianmag.com
. This area, nestled in the dense foothill jungles, revealed over 6,000 rectangular earthen terraces and platforms, forming at least 15 villages connected by a sophisticated road network
smithsonianmag.com
smithsonianmag.com
. The roads are remarkably straight, intersecting at right angles and cutting through rough terrain – a sign of intentional city planning and engineering
smithsonianmag.com
. Archaeologists identified wide causeways, irrigation canals, and evidence of intensive agriculture (likely maize and sweet potato cultivation) supporting what may have been tens of thousands of inhabitants
smithsonianmag.com
smithsonianmag.com
. This discovery, led by Stéphen Rostain (CNRS, France) alongside Ecuadorean scholars, marks the oldest large-scale Amazonian urban system known and shows that even the mountain rainforest was no barrier to complex society. The success in Ecuador implies that other Andean fringe areas of the Amazon may hold undiscovered sites. Northern Peru’s Amazonian departments (e.g. Amazonas, San Martín, Loreto) feature similar foothill valleys and intermontane basins that could have supported sizeable ancient populations. Indeed, some large mound complexes and walled sites have been recorded in these zones, though systematic remote sensing is only beginning. Researchers are eyeing regions like the Marañón and Huallaga river headwaters and the fringes of the Andes-Amazon interface for LiDAR surveys, expecting to find patterned earthworks or settlement grids analogous to the Upano finds. These areas were cultural frontiers – likely zones of interaction between highland civilizations and lowland peoples. For example, trade goods and roads from the Inca and pre-Inca cultures penetrated downriver into Amazonia, and conversely, Amazonian products (crops, feathers, etc.) moved uphill. Such corridors might host fortified towns, ceremonial centers, or terraced agricultural landscapes now overgrown by cloud forest. Although systematic studies in the Peruvian and Colombian Amazon foothills lag behind Ecuador, the paradigm has shifted: archaeologists now regard the Andean-Amazon transition as a hotspot where “lost” polities could be hidden. National Geographic and university teams (e.g. University of Geneva’s projects in Peru) have begun exploring these areas with remote sensing and drone mapping. The expectation is that more ancient “cities of the clouds” will emerge, underscoring that the Amazon’s periphery was as much a cradle of civilization as its interior

Guiana Shield (Northern Amazon) – Megalithic Structures on the Hilltops
In the far north of the Amazon Basin, the Guiana Shield region (encompassing parts of Brazil, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana) is gaining attention for its unique archaeological signatures. This area of uplands and table-top hills has yielded surprising finds: most notably, megalithic stone arrangements in Amapá state, Brazil. In Amapá’s Calçoene municipality, Indigenous peoples constructed large stone circles and alignments – dubbed the “Amazon Stonehenge” – likely for astronomical and ceremonial purposes
facebook.com
. These megaliths, reported by Brazilian archaeologists in the mid-2000s, include granite blocks up to 3–4 meters tall set upright in circular plazas. They appear to mark solar solstices and other celestial events, indicating an advanced knowledge of astronomy. Subsequent research (e.g. by the Amapá Institute of Scientific and Technological Research) has identified several related sites on hilltops, suggesting a broader megalithic tradition in the region
malaymail.com
. Beyond the stones, recent remote sensing has revealed earthworks on the crowned hills of the northern Amazon. The 2023 lidar study discovered six new archaeological sites in Amapá (near Laranjal do Jari, Ferreira Gomes, and Oiapoque) located on elevated terrains or mesas
news.mongabay.com
. These sites included permanent settlements with earthwork terraces as well as associated megalithic features. Researchers describe the hilltop earthworks as serving both “domestic and ceremonial functions,” perhaps villages fortified by natural elevation
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. The stone constructions at some sites were purely ceremonial – for example, standing stones likely used as ritual observatories or markers
news.mongabay.com
. This indicates a pattern wherein ancient communities of the Guiana Shield built their villages in strategically chosen high places and erected stone monuments for ritual use. Given that vast swaths of the Guiana Shield remain archaeologically unexplored (covered by jungle or inaccessible highlands), it is very likely more such megalithic or earthwork sites await discovery. Archaeologists from Brazil’s Museu Goeldi and French Guiana’s CNRS have begun surveying interior Guiana forests, combining satellite imagery with ground patrols, and have already pinpointed geometric earthwork traces and unusual vegetation patches on some remote plateaus. These could signal undiscovered settlements or ritual sites analogous to those in Amapá. In addition, the Guiana Shield’s many rock shelters and cliffs (e.g. in southern Venezuela) are known for extensive ancient rock art, hinting at a deep human presence. While rock art is not a built structure, it reinforces that the whole region was inhabited and culturally active – increasing the odds that structural sites like mounds, plazas, or fortifications are also hidden in the landscape. The northern Amazon’s upland jungles are thus a hotspot of interest, where the use of LiDAR and careful ground-truthing may soon illuminate an archaeological record of megalith-building cultures that has only begun to be appreciated

Central Amazon (River Basins and Interfluves) – Terra Preta Landscapes and Subtle Sites
Even the central Amazon, historically thought to be a sparsely populated rainforest, contains clues that numerous undiscovered sites lie under its canopy. Along the major river corridors – such as the Amazon River itself and large tributaries like the Madeira, Purús, and Negro – archaeologists have found dense concentrations of Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE), also called terra preta. These are fertile, human-created soils rich in charcoal and organic waste, formed by prolonged settlement activity. Surveys in recent years have mapped hundreds of ADE patches on bluffs and high terraces flanking the Amazon and its tributaries
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Each patch of dark earth often corresponds to an ancient village or town, sometimes with low mounds or posthole patterns indicating houses. Notably, ADE sites are especially common near confluences and in nutrient-rich varzea (floodplain) zones, and even along the Atlantic coast of Brazil
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This suggests that large, sedentary communities thrived in the central Amazon, contradicting old notions that the poor soils prevented agriculture. Recent studies have extended ADE surveys into interfluvial zones (areas away from the big rivers), finding that even some upland forests contain scattered dark earth loci
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This wider distribution implies that ancient people managed to sustain village life in a range of environments by creating these soil “islands of fertility.” While many ADE sites near modern towns have been known (often found when farmers encounter black soil and pottery shards), countless others in remote areas remain unrecorded. Archaeologists from Brazil’s National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA) and University of São Paulo have active programs testing soil and vegetation to pinpoint such sites. Intriguingly, a 2023 study found that the presence of certain domesticated tree species in a patch of forest can be a strong indicator of ancient human habitation nearby
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. Researchers identified 50+ tree species (like Brazil nut, peach palm, cacao, and others) that were likely planted or encouraged by past Amazonians, and these often occur in clusters around archaeological sites
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. By mapping these “archaeophyte” trees, scientists have highlighted new target areas for exploration. For example, parts of the middle Madeira and Negro basins (e.g. Brazil’s Matupiri and Jaú reserves) emerged as hotspots of likely unseen sites due to high densities of useful tree species and favorable terrain
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Indeed, predictive models flag regions like the Ituxi River Extractive Reserve (between the Purús and Madeira Rivers) and the Serra de Tumucumaque area (Brazil-Guyana border) as having >80% probability of undiscovered archaeological sites
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These central Amazon sites might not be as monumental as the big earthworks down south, but they could include large village mounds, ceremonial centers, fisheries, or even defensive earthworks on a smaller scale. Notably, the 2023 lidar survey did identify two previously unknown earthworks in the central Amazon: one in Amazonas state (Boa Vista do Ramos) and one in Pará (Óbidos), both near waterways
news.mongabay.com
. These appear to be ancient riverine sites on floodplains used for seasonal harvesting of aquatic resources
news.mongabay.com
. Their discovery reinforces that the central Amazon’s floodplains and even some interior forests conceal archaeological features, awaiting further exploration. With continuing deforestation (unfortunately) exposing some sites and, preferably, new non-invasive remote sensing campaigns, archaeologists anticipate a steady stream of finds from the heart of Amazonia. Every new site – whether a hilltop earthwork or a dark earth village – adds to the emerging picture that even the Amazon’s most isolated interfluves were culturally inhabited landscapes, not pristine voids

Conclusion
From the geometric “earth tattoos” of Acre to the pyramids of Bolivian savannas, and from Ecuador’s buried cities to Amapá’s hilltop rings of stone, the Amazon rainforest is revealing an extraordinary archaeological wealth. Recent studies underscore that certain regions – particularly the southern rim of Amazonia, the upper tributary basins, the Andean fringe, the Guiana highlands, and the fertile river valleys – are likely to contain numerous undiscovered sites of varying scale and function. The application of remote sensing tools like LiDAR has been pivotal in this paradigm shift, allowing scientists to pierce the canopy and map ancient landscapes in unprecedented detail. Machine learning models and botanical clues (such as distributions of domesticated trees) are further helping predict where human settlements once were, even in areas long presumed pristine
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

. Crucially, this wave of discovery is not just about finding “lost cities” for curiosity’s sake – it is reshaping our understanding of Indigenous Amazonian history and informing current policy. Many of these sites are found in or near territories of contemporary Indigenous peoples, strengthening their claims of deep ancestral ties to the land
news.mongabay.com
news.mongabay.com
. Archaeology in Amazonia is thus a rapidly evolving field, combining cutting-edge technology with collaborative research (often involving local communities and international teams). As exploration continues, we can expect more surprises: entire cultural landscapes will likely emerge in what are today blank spots on the map. The evidence so far points to a clear conclusion – the Amazon was never an empty green desert, but a culturally rich patchwork of societies, many of whose physical footprints remain concealed by the forest, waiting to be unearthed by the next generation of researchers
