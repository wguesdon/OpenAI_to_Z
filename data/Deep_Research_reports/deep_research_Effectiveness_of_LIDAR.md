# Effectiveness of LIDAR for Detecting Amazonian Earthworks and Geoglyphs

Restatement of the Question: Investigate how effective LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has been in detecting earthworks and geoglyphs in the Amazon region, focusing specifically on archaeological applications. Limit the scope to discoveries and research published or reported since 2020. Include a comparison of LIDAR with other technologies such as satellite imagery and ground surveys, highlighting both advantages and limitations.

## LIDAR’s Impact on Discovering Earthworks and Geoglyphs in the Amazon (2020–2025)

Recent advances in airborne LIDAR have dramatically improved archaeologists’ ability to locate and map ancient earthworks and geoglyphs hidden beneath the Amazon’s dense rainforest canopy. Since 2020, LIDAR-based surveys have uncovered dozens of previously unknown pre-Columbian structures across the Amazon, revolutionizing our understanding of the region’s past human activity

LIDAR’s effectiveness stems from its ability to “see” through vegetation and produce high-resolution digital elevation models of the ground surface. By digitally stripping away the forest canopy, LIDAR can reveal subtle man-made features like ditches, mounds, roads and canals that are otherwise invisible from the air or ground

. In the Bolivian Amazon, a 2022 LIDAR survey exposed a network of 26 ancient settlements (including 11 previously unknown sites) of the Casarabe culture, complete with monumental platform mounds and raised causeways connecting them

. These sprawling urban-like complexes had eluded explorers for centuries, but became clearly identifiable once the LIDAR data “digitally deforested” the landscape

. Similarly, in 2024, archaeologists used LIDAR in eastern Ecuador to reveal 2,500-year-old city sites with an extensive network of roads and agricultural terraces that decades of traditional fieldwork had failed to fully discern

. According to the lead researcher Stéphen Rostain, “on foot, you have trees in the way, and it’s difficult to see what’s actually hidden there,” whereas LIDAR provided a comprehensive view of the ancient settlements beneath the jungle canopy

.

Beyond large settlements, LIDAR has proven adept at detecting the Amazon’s geometric earthworks (known as geoglyphs) in forested areas. Many of these geometric ditched enclosures in southwestern Amazonia were first noticed via satellite imagery after modern deforestation, and over 1,000 are known in cleared zones of Acre and Mato Grosso

. However, LIDAR surveys are now finding additional geoglyphs still hidden under intact rainforest that satellites and earlier ground expeditions missed

. For instance, researchers analyzing publicly available LIDAR data (originally collected for forestry) in Acre have discovered new circular and rectangular geoglyph complexes beneath the canopy

. One recent machine-learning study guided by LIDAR and environmental data led to the identification of 13 previously unknown geoglyph sites by pinpointing high-probability locations and then confirming them via imagery and field checks

. All these findings underscore that LIDAR is now an indispensable tool for Amazonian archaeology – it consistently reveals more sites, and more complex site layouts, than were ever suspected from earlier methods

## Comparison with Other Detection Technologies

While LIDAR has opened a new era of discovery in the Amazon, it is helpful to compare its performance to other technologies like satellite imaging and traditional ground surveying:

### Satellite Imagery (Optical & Aerial Photos)
Satellite and aerial imagery have historically helped identify Amazonian earthworks, but primarily in areas where vegetation has been removed. High-resolution satellite photos (e.g. Google Earth or commercial imagery) enabled scientists to spot numerous geometric earthworks in deforested parts of southwestern Amazonia
peerj.com
. In fact, a 2018 study using satellite data revealed that supposedly “sparsely inhabited” regions in Mato Grosso were actually dotted with village sites and large geometric ditched enclosures once the tree cover was gone

. The advantage of satellite imagery is its broad coverage and relatively low cost – large swaths of land can be surveyed remotely, and known sites can be monitored over time. However, optical satellites cannot penetrate dense forest canopy, which means they miss any archaeological features still covered by trees
smithsonianmag.com
smithsonianmag.com
. Researchers note that earlier discoveries with satellites were limited to cleared areas, whereas “with lidar, you no longer have to cut down the forest to know what is underneath it”
smithsonianmag.com
. In essence, satellite imagery is excellent for mapping sites in open terrain, but it is blind to most of the Amazon’s hidden earthworks still protected by jungle.

There are other remote sensing approaches, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, which use microwave radar that can penetrate vegetation to some degree. SAR data (especially longer wavelengths) can sometimes reveal large-scale features like mounded fields or ancient causeways under canopy, but its resolution and interpretability for subtle archaeological features are generally inferior to airborne LIDAR. Thus far, SAR has not played a major role in Amazonian archaeology, whereas LIDAR’s detailed 3D mapping has been far more decisive in locating small-scale earthworks. In practice, satellite tools are often used in tandem with LIDAR – for instance, to scan for promising areas or to observe newly exposed sites where deforestation occurs – but they cannot replace LIDAR for seeing fine topography beneath an intact forest.

### Ground Surveys and Traditional Fieldwork
On-the-ground exploration and survey remain fundamental for archaeological research in the Amazon, but they have severe limitations when it comes to initial discovery of sites. In the thick rainforest, ground teams can only cover limited areas and often have very low visibility due to vegetation. Small earthworks like shallow ditches or low mounds are easily missed when walking on the forest floor. For example, archaeologists had traversed parts of the Bolivian Amazon for years, yet the existence of large interconnected settlements went unrecognized until aerial LIDAR revealed the pattern from above
smithsonianmag.com
. As one researcher remarked about the LIDAR findings, “patterning that’s just not visible from the ground” suddenly became apparent, exposing settlement layouts and an unexpected level of social complexity
smithsonianmag.com
. Ground surveyors simply cannot achieve that bird’s-eye perspective through dense canopy.

The advantage of traditional fieldwork is the ability to verify and study sites in detail once they are found. Excavations can uncover artifacts, dates, and ecological evidence that LIDAR cannot provide. However, using ground survey alone to find new sites in the Amazon is extremely slow and often serendipitous – many sites were discovered only when logging or agriculture cleared the forest. LIDAR, by contrast, can systematically scan inaccessible areas and direct archaeologists exactly where to investigate on foot. In the Ecuador case, Stéphen Rostain noted that even after exploring the area many times on foot, he did not “see what’s actually hidden there” until the LIDAR survey revealed the full site plan

. In summary, ground exploration is crucial for contextualizing and confirming LIDAR discoveries (and remains the only way to obtain certain information), but it cannot match LIDAR’s efficiency in detecting buried earthworks across vast, forested landscapes.

## Limitations of LIDAR in the Amazon Context

Despite its transformative successes, LIDAR technology also has limitations and practical challenges in Amazonian archaeology. First, the cost and logistical effort of airborne LIDAR surveys are high. Scanning even a relatively small region of the Amazon can require years of planning, flying, and data processing. For example, the five-year LIDAR survey that identified 24 new sites only covered about 2,000 square miles (0.08% of the Amazon)

. Mapping the entire Amazon at that resolution would be prohibitively expensive with current resources, meaning vast areas remain unscanned. Initiatives like the “Earth Archive” project have advocated for large-scale LIDAR mapping before development or deforestation destroys sites, but funding and coordinating such an effort across multiple countries is a significant hurdle

.

Secondly, LIDAR data must be correctly interpreted – distinguishing ancient earthworks from natural terrain variations can be challenging. Not every bump or depression is anthropogenic, so archaeologists must ground-truth LIDAR findings. Small or heavily eroded features might still escape detection depending on LIDAR resolution and point density. Additionally, certain environments (e.g. seasonally flooded areas or thick swamp vegetation) can complicate data collection; water surfaces and saturated soils may return poor signals, potentially hiding low-relief sites in wetlands. Another limitation is that LIDAR reveals shape and topography but not the age or purpose of a feature – it cannot directly detect artifacts or organic remains. Excavation and other archaeological methods are needed to determine whether a LIDAR-identified mound was a habitation site, a burial, or a natural hill.

Finally, there are practical constraints like regulatory and environmental concerns. Flying LIDAR missions over remote rainforest requires appropriate permits and suitable weather windows (heavy rain can interfere with data quality). The technology’s reliance on aircraft means that extremely rugged or dangerous areas (or conflict zones) might be difficult to survey. Despite these limitations, the consensus in recent studies is that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks: LIDAR has unequivocally expanded the known distribution of Amazonian earthworks and will continue to do so as more areas are surveyed

. Researchers are combining LIDAR with predictive models and even information on ancient tree domestication to prioritize sites, making future surveys more targeted and cost-effective
news.mongabay.com
. In summary, LIDAR is not a replacement for traditional archaeology, but it is an extraordinarily effective complement – one that has already led to a paradigm shift in understanding the Amazon’s archaeological landscape since 2020.
