# Undiscovered Archaeological Potential in the Brazilian Amazon: A Synthesis of Recent Peer-Reviewed Research

Recent advances in remote sensing technology and predictive modeling have revolutionized our understanding of pre-Columbian occupation in the Brazilian Amazon. Based on peer-reviewed literature from 2015-2025, an estimated **10,272 to 23,648 archaeological sites remain undiscovered** beneath the forest canopy, with the highest concentrations in southwestern Amazonia.

## Priority Regions with GPS Coordinates

### 1. Southwestern Amazonia - Highest Archaeological Potential

**Acre-Rondônia Border Region**
- **Coordinates**: 9°-11°S, 65°-67°W
- **Model Confidence**: >0.7 probability
- **Supporting Literature**: Peripato et al. (2023), *Science* (DOI: 10.1126/science.ade2541)
- **Rationale**: This region shows the highest concentration of predicted earthworks based on Bayesian modeling of 961 known sites. Environmental factors including seasonal precipitation (1,400-2,200mm annually), elevation (180-280m), and proximity to the Iquiri River system create optimal conditions for earthwork construction.
- **Known Features**: 450+ documented geoglyphs with geometric patterns (circles, squares, U-forms), suggesting extensive unexplored areas between known sites.

**Eastern Acre - Purus River Interfluves**
- **Coordinates**: 8°-10°S, 68°-70°W  
- **Elevation**: 180-250m
- **Supporting Literature**: Watling et al. (2018), *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*
- **Rationale**: Bamboo-dominated forests and proximity to small streams correlate with high archaeological potential. The area between known Acre geoglyphs remains largely unexplored despite favorable environmental conditions.

### 2. Upper Tapajós Basin - Extensive Earthwork Complex

**Primary Survey Area**
- **Coordinates**: 13°-15°S, 56°-58°W
- **Verified Sites**: 104 earthworks across 81 archaeological sites
- **Supporting Literature**: de Souza et al. (2023), *Nature Communications* (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03510-7)
- **Rationale**: MaxEnt modeling predicts 400+ additional geoglyphs in this region. The area represents a continuous 1,800 km cultural belt with population estimates of 500,000-1 million people (1250-1500 CE).
- **Unexplored Zones**: Interfluvial areas up to 40 km from navigable rivers show high potential based on known settlement patterns.

### 3. Território Indígena do Xingu (TIX) - Terra Preta Concentrations

**Kuhikugu Complex and Extensions**
- **Central Coordinates**: 12°33'30"S, 53°6'40"W
- **Area Coverage**: 26,000 km² with 3-4% terra preta distribution
- **Supporting Literature**: Schmidt et al. (2023), *Science Advances* (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adh8499)
- **Rationale**: Only 5 of an estimated 20+ archaeological sites have been documented. Terra preta distributions indicate extensive pre-Columbian occupation with intentional soil management dating 300-5,000 years BP.
- **Technological Evidence**: Remote sensing identified 9 Mt of carbon sequestered in Amazonian Dark Earth deposits, suggesting widespread human modification.

### 4. Central Amazon Interfluves

**Madeira-Tapajós Interfluve**
- **Coordinates**: 7°-10°S, 58°-62°W
- **Supporting Literature**: Multiple studies from Central Amazon Project (CAP)
- **Rationale**: Terra firme areas between major river systems show settlement patterns distinct from riverine sites. Elevation zones of 140-300m remain largely unexplored despite favorable conditions.

**Specific High-Potential Locations**:
- Between Madeira and Tapajós rivers
- Xingu headwaters interfluves  
- Areas with high domesticated tree species diversity (Brazil nut, cacao, rubber)

### 5. Santarém-Belterra Plateau Complex

**Belterra Plateau Extensions**
- **Coordinates**: 2°38'11"S, 54°56'14"W
- **Verified Features**: 17 confirmed but unexcavated sites >2 hectares
- **Supporting Literature**: Söderström et al. (2016), *Geoderma*
- **Rationale**: Remote sensing identified extensive terra preta formations correlating with defensive earthworks. 69.5% of 108 recorded sites located on plateaus rising to 200m elevation.
- **Archaeological Potential**: Sites dating 1300 CE to European contact with Tapajó/Santarém Phase pottery distributions.

### 6. Northern Mato Grosso Extensions

**Coordinates**: 10°-13°S, 55°-58°W
- **Supporting Literature**: INPE remote sensing initiative (Peripato et al., 2023)
- **Rationale**: Represents the continuation of the documented Southern Rim settlement belt. Areas between Upper Xingu and Upper Tapajós discoveries show high probability for interconnected sites based on road network patterns.

## Environmental Predictors and Site Characteristics

Recent peer-reviewed studies identify key environmental factors correlating with archaeological sites:

**Optimal Elevation Range**: 140-320m above sea level
- Flat landscapes with gentle hills
- Hilltops and small plateaus overlooking water sources

**Distance from Water**: 
- Traditional assumption: Within 10km of rivers
- New findings: Up to 40km from navigable waterways in Acre/Upper Tapajós

**Climate Indicators**:
- Pronounced seasonality (700-1000mm wet quarter, 50-120mm dry quarter)
- High temperature variation (14-24°C annual range)
- Well-drained oxisols suitable for earthwork construction

**Biological Markers**:
- 53 domesticated tree species strongly associated with sites
- Terra preta (Amazonian Dark Earth) presence
- Brazil nut groves indicating ancient forest management

## Technological Advances Informing Site Prediction

## Conclusion

The convergence of LiDAR technology, predictive modeling, and terra preta research has identified specific regions in the Brazilian Amazon with exceptional archaeological potential. **Southwestern Amazonia emerges as the highest priority**, with model predictions suggesting thousands of undiscovered sites. The combination of precise GPS coordinates, environmental predictors, and recent technological advances provides an unprecedented roadmap for systematic archaeological exploration. Priority should focus on the 400,000 km² predicted zone in southwestern Brazil, particularly areas showing seasonal dry forests at 140-320m elevation with high domesticated tree species diversity. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about the Amazon as a "pristine wilderness" and reveal instead a landscape extensively modified by sophisticated pre-Columbian civilizations over millennia.
